Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Hotels in Mumbai are generally quite expensive, but since it was my first time, I chose a well-known and reliable place. It faces Marine Drive, and it's just within walking distance to the Gateway of India (about 20 minutes).

Every time I entered the hotel, there was a security check. The room was a non-smoking ocean view premier double room. From the window, you can see the Arabian Sea in full view. The size was ample, and the amenities were all provided, with additional items like nail clippers and nail remover as well. The flowers displayed were fresh, and there was a welcome fruit basket as well. 

There was a bathtub, but the shower was only fixed and a rain shower, which made it a bit difficult when I just wanted to wash my feet. When I left my PC on the desk, a screen cleaner was placed there on the second day. Even though I left a tip daily, it was never picked up. On the final day, I left a tip along with a ""Thank you"" message.

There is a fitness gym, sauna, and an outdoor pool. I received a 90-minute treatment at the spa. It cost 8,000 rupees for the 90 minutes, which is quite pricey, but it felt nice.","There was a bathtub, but the shower was only fixed and a rain shower, which made it a bit difficult when I just wanted to wash my feet",0.0444,0.2495,0.4938,0.1945,0.0178,2.892,2e_1

Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I enjoyed myself during my stay at Trident a nariman point. 

Firstly I like the high level of security performed by the staff. Although this can be seen in other 5 star hotels. One of my friends bought a dagger from Amritsar for religious purpose and the Hotel staff informed that for safety purposes they would keep it till we check out. Couldn't agree with them more.

Check -in was fast and we were given an option to upgrade ( to top up the difference) as it came with free wifi. I agreed and also signed up for membership. The room was what I had expected, views of the sea just by lying on my bed. The room was spacious and clean. 

One of the nights, I planned to have dinner at Taj president hotel and enquired on how to get there. The staff went a step further and informed me that he will make a reservation as it could be crowded. I was impressed. 

Location wise, I feel it's near to the tourist attractions which is a short auto ride away. I went to Mumbai during the mosoon period and whenever I came out of the hotel, the wind was so strong.

Check in was quick, view from room nice, staff is very attentive and helpful, knowledgeable and polite, make you feel comfortable, handle special requests well. Great training there it seems.

Room had a comfortable bed, desk, chair and the amazing view. Fresh fruits complementary and the tab water is potable - that must cost a fortune! Room had a bathtub with shower which was nice. 

Our room was not cleaned properly, hair and peanuts of the previous tenants on the floor, no toothpaste in the bathroom, etc. Was a bit of a surprise...

The lifts suck. Not that this is a big issue but we were not the only guests who were not quick enough to enter or  who missed their stop as the lifts stopped randomly or who stood in the lobby while all lifts were on the top floors.

We had a stroller which means access to the breakfast room in the basement is via the service elevator. Good fun for us but I am sure tough for old people who can‚Äôt climb stairs, etc. Also to get to the Oberoi there are a lot of stairs and no other access.

Breakfast was good but I don‚Äôt understand why a seafront hotel would have two restaurants in the basement!?

Our room was not cleaned properly, hair and peanuts of the previous tenants on the floor, no toothpaste in the bathroom, etc. Was a bit of a surprise...

The lifts suck. Not that this is a big issue but we were not the only guests who were not quick enough to enter or  who missed their stop as the lifts stopped randomly or who stood in the lobby while all lifts were on the top floors.

We had a stroller which means access to the breakfast room in the basement is via the service elevator. Good fun for us but I am sure tough for old people who can‚Äôt climb stairs, etc. Also to get to the Oberoi there are a lot of stairs and no other access.

Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I only stayed at the Trident for one night, a quick business trip to Mumbai. I arrived in the early hours of the morning so it took less than 1hr for the taxi to reach the hotel. I booked a hotel car back to the airport, again later in the day (about 8pm) and it took 75 minutes... in the rush hour it would probably take much longer. The location is fine if you have meetings in that part of the city, and plenty of time to catch flights, but otherwise I might stay in one of the hotels closer to the airport.

The hotel is obviously expensive compared to most others (although not the most expensive on this site) so my expectations were high. The staff were friendly, and check-in was efficient. The hotel room was fine (I was upgraded to a sea view)... the hotel room was a little dated for my tastes, it would benefit from upgraded bathrooms etc. 

The internet was not free (it seems that the more expensive the hotel, the more likely they are to charge for internet access)... someone needs to tell them that free wifi is now expected by most travellers. 

There are a couple of restaurants in the basement, one only opens at 7.30pm... (the same time the buffet starts in the other) so maybe not great if you like to eat early.

"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I cannot rate this hotel high enough. From a luxury point of view, it is amazing and the hotel is beautiful. But the service was just incredible and is what sets it above others. We arrived about 5.30am and we told we could pay a half board to have the room ready by 7am. This gave us time to have breakfast in quiet surroundings with a personal butler. To continue the great service we were upgraded to the Palace side which I would recommend paying more to stay in anyway. Each night we came back to our room to find personal gifts such as cake, silk scarves, Indian jewellery and one night 2 foot bathes were set up for my husband and I - the water was promptly delivered for us. Just what we needed after walking a lot in the heat. Relaxing in the pool each afternoon was also wonderful, and again the service by the pool staff was fantastic. Compared to other countries, the prices for accommodation and breakfast was very reasonable and so worth it.
In Mumbai, I would say go to Leopolds for beer and cheap curry, good fun and great taste. To upgrade a little, there is a local restaurant not far called Khyber - best Indian food we have ever had. 
With the help of a Dharavi local based tour company, Mystical Mumbai, we had an eye opening tour of the slum which we recommend. Make sure you check the taxi meters are on and you can rent a taxi for about 350 rupees an hour.

"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Overall we had a fantastic stay, Mumbai was our last stop of our family trip to India, brilliant way to end a great holiday, Mumbai is one of the nicest, and the best places we visited in India..
The hotel was lovely we had 2 club rooms, in the Palace. My only complaint was that both at breakfast and during the cocktail hour we were kept waiting to enter before we could enjoy the facilities, however the timings were up held so if the cocktail hour was until 8 and you weren't able to enter the club room till late (due to lack of space) they would still stop serving at 8 which I though was a bit unfair, all guests should be accommodated accordingly, same with the breakfast, the sea lounge couldn't accommodate everyone at the busier times so you could be kept waiting outside for up to 20 mins, one of the mornings the buffet was being cleared away before we had even finished (the staff did let us know that this was about to happen but they had already started clearing it at the very same time so we didn't chance to enjoy breakfast properly) they did apologise after I complained. Again I didn't see it fair that after having had to wait (which I didn't mind) but then, that they would not then extend the timings accordingly allowing those guests to enjoy breakfast fully, they were very apologetic about this, I'm not sure if anyone else had complained about this but with all the attention to detail and high quality service I felt these were 2 areas (quite important though) do need looking, apart from this our stay was brilliant... my husband fell ill, they organised a doctor very quickly for us (who was very good).. oh and lastly I have to say how amazing the building tour guide was, unfortunately we cant remember the guys name, but he was fantastic!!So knowledgeable and entertaining!!","my husband fell ill, they organised a doctor very quickly for us (who was very good)",0.1413,0.21,0.2339,0.2248,0.19,3.1121,3g

why i won't stay in this hotel again:
- the staff is always hungry for tips. i'm not sure if it's because tom cruise tipped all the staff $ bills each or it's just the general attitude in mumbai... my friend and i was carrying 2 small luggage, a staff offered to bring them up to our room and we didn't have small change to tip him so we smiled ""thank you."" he just stayed there waiting... staring at us with an odd grin. we said ""thank you"" again but he dind't leave. so we ended up giving him $5-> my indian friend said a tip of $1-2 is the norm for hotel staff... and this happened again to us when we were leaving the hotel. 
- the front desk is unfriendly and a little unprofessional. we requested for room on higher floor, quieter, facing the ocean. she didn't even tell us what room she gave us and smiled ""here's you key, your room is ready."" when we went up we realized, she gave us room on 4th floor, facing the main town, which is full of honking noise until 1am... we were too tired to argue as we checkin in at 1030pm.

why we might return to this hotel:
- best location in mumbai... unless there'll be a new hotel built in the area soon! i hope this happens! plenty of amazing restaurants walkable from the hotel... and it's relatively safe because there is a college nearby~",""" when we went up we realized, she gave us room on 4th floor, facing the main town, which is full of honking noise until 1am",0.2752,0.312,0.1845,0.1362,0.0921,2.458,4a

Check in procedure is prompt and relaxed, individual attention seated within the lobby area.
The rooms had sea views and are clean with everything you need. Bathrooms had great electronic blinds!
There are various activities -  there is a boat trip every day at 5pm to see great sunsets by chinese fishing nets, traditional indian dance and great ayurvedic spa treatments.
The staff go out of their way to help.
As with most Indian hotels the wine is really expensive and Indian wine not always very good.

But the service was just incredible and is what sets it above others. We arrived about 5.30am and we told we could pay a half board to have the room ready by 7am. This gave us time to have breakfast in quiet surroundings with a personal butler. To continue the great service we were upgraded to the Palace side which I would recommend paying more to stay in anyway. Each night we came back to our room to find personal gifts such as cake, silk scarves, Indian jewellery and one night 2 foot bathes were set up for my husband and I - the water was promptly delivered for us. Just what we needed after walking a lot in the heat. Relaxing in the pool each afternoon was also wonderful, and again the service by the pool staff was fantastic. Compared to other countries, the prices for accommodation and breakfast was very reasonable and so worth it.
In Mumbai, I would say go to Leopolds for beer and cheap curry, good fun and great taste. To upgrade a little, there is a local restaurant not far called Khyber - best Indian food we have ever had. 
With the help of a Dharavi local based tour company, Mystical Mumbai, we had an eye opening tour of the slum which we recommend.

The hotel was lovely we had 2 club rooms, in the Palace. My only complaint was that both at breakfast and during the cocktail hour we were kept waiting to enter before we could enjoy the facilities, however the timings were up held so if the cocktail hour was until 8 and you weren't able to enter the club room till late (due to lack of space) they would still stop serving at 8 which I though was a bit unfair, all guests should be accommodated accordingly, same with the breakfast, the sea lounge couldn't accommodate everyone at the busier times so you could be kept waiting outside for up to 20 mins, one of the mornings the buffet was being cleared away before we had even finished (the staff did let us know that this was about to happen but they had already started clearing it at the very same time so we didn't chance to enjoy breakfast properly) they did apologise after I complained. Again I didn't see it fair that after having had to wait (which I didn't mind) but then, that they would not then extend the timings accordingly allowing those guests to enjoy breakfast fully, they were very apologetic about this, I'm not sure if anyone else had complained about this but with all the attention to detail and high quality service I felt these were 2 areas (quite important though) do need looking, apart from this our stay was brilliant... my husband fell ill, they organised a doctor very quickly for us (who was very good).. oh and lastly I have to say how amazing the building tour guide was, unfortunately we cant remember the guys name, but he was fantastic!!So knowledgeable and entertaining!!","my husband fell ill, they organised a doctor very quickly for us (who was very good)",0.1413,0.21,0.2339,0.2248,0.19,3.1121,3g

- my indian friends said it's the hotel in mumbai
- it was featured in mi4 (note that the movie only showcased the ballroom and the suite floor... when u stay in this hotel, will u be going to the ballroom or the suite floor?)

why i won't stay in this hotel again:
- the staff is always hungry for tips. i'm not sure if it's because tom cruise tipped all the staff $ bills each or it's just the general attitude in mumbai... my friend and i was carrying 2 small luggage, a staff offered to bring them up to our room and we didn't have small change to tip him so we smiled ""thank you."" he just stayed there waiting... staring at us with an odd grin. we said ""thank you"" again but he dind't leave. so we ended up giving him $5-> my indian friend said a tip of $1-2 is the norm for hotel staff... and this happened again to us when we were leaving the hotel. 
- the front desk is unfriendly and a little unprofessional. we requested for room on higher floor, quieter, facing the ocean. she didn't even tell us what room she gave us and smiled ""here's you key, your room is ready."" when we went up we realized, she gave us room on 4th floor, facing the main town, which is full of honking noise until 1am... we were too tired to argue as we checkin in at 1030pm.
