Staff is extremely courteous and helpful. Room was quite well equipped and very clean. I had the runners (small carpets) removed from my room as I felt only they were not clean. Found a cockroach one day, because my room was on same floor as one restaurant, I think that could be a source for the cockroach. Pool and gym was very well maintained. No one was available in the spa though, not on phone nor on the spa reception, so I couldn't get a massage. In room Dining options were limited, and for a single person the food with 2 portions was too much to eat, leading to wastage. Breakfast spread was great, some specific staff in the restaurant could do with a better training on cleaning the tables, not forgetting an order and attending the guests quickly though. All in all, I would choose to stay there again if I am in Chennai.","April 19, 2025"

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"The hotel belies its five star status claim. Nothing to rave about the hotel. A single dental kit, single pair of socks, two towels made us to think that the room and facilities were meant for a single occupant. We were told while checking in that our room was being ‘upgraded..’We wonder what would be the condition of an un-upgraded room. 
Bath water was leaking out of the bathroom into the adjoining area.  Toilet was tiny as tiny can be. The positive about the hotel was a good restaurant ‘Six O One’, where we had our breakfast.","April 08, 2025"

The room and washroom facilities are made of material that are of the lowest quality - even if the cleaning staff cleaned the facilities for 24 hours it would not change as the material used is of very cheap quality - there were only two redeeming features about the room and they were comfortable beds and drinking water in glass bottles.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"Our stay at the hotel was overall pleasant, and we appreciated the comfortable accommodations. However, we have a few suggestions that could make the experience even better for future guests. The toilet cubicle felt a bit small and tight, which could be improved for added comfort. Additionally, the draining system in the bathroom could be enhanced, as we noticed some water stagnation on the floor. The marble flooring, while elegant, felt quite cold, so perhaps a warmer alternative could be considered. Lastly, the walkway in the room was a bit narrow, especially with the addition of a round table and armchair, making it slightly challenging to navigate. Despite these minor points, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to others. Thank you for your hospitality!","March 31, 2025"

Also, there is a cap on the number of devices that can connect to the wifi from the same room, and I had to pester them multiple times to get all my family's devices connected.

The rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and beautifully designed, offering a perfect blend of comfort and luxury. The bed was incredibly cozy, and the amenities, including a well-stocked minibar, plush linens, and a stylish bathroom, made my stay even more enjoyable.

One of the highlights was the hotel’s rooftop pool and bar, which provided a relaxing escape with stunning views of the city skyline. The dining options were exceptional, with a variety of delicious cuisines and impeccable service. The breakfast buffet had a great selection of local and international dishes, all freshly prepared and flavorful.

The staff at The Park Chennai were attentive, courteous, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure a pleasant stay. Whether for business or leisure, this hotel is a fantastic choice, and I would love to visit again!","March 31, 2025"

There’s an old wing and a new wing of rooms. Only complainants are given the new rooms, I guess. Except the hostess Ms Linda on the roof top restaurant, the hotel lacked hospitality, in general.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"1)Room provided to us was not 5 star facilities, very small, it has old items including furniture. Room smelled very bad, it stinks. Bathroom tub reminded me of horror movie one. They put steel tumblers to put your toothbrush, not a five star thing. I got stuck in the washroom due to door lock jammed. Commode was small and place it is put up is very small I could not sit properly. Out side my room some renovation work happening in the lobby including painting of walls, I could hear renovation work loud noise from my room. 
Definitely not worth the price they charge.

 2) Swimming pool Towels are very very very old, threads are coming out of it at the edges, faded., Texture was bad. Not definitely a 5star stuff. 

3)Few staff at Buffet Are not serving food properly, not responding properly. Few staff were good though. And I saw one of the staff from the bar in uniform having Beer near the pool. Pool depth was not displayed properly, which may result in accident if kids jump with out noticing it.
 4) Front end desk team are not at all responding properly, they don’t even call u sir or Mam. 

 Manager upgraded the room, appreciated. However 
I had to wait for half day for that with 2-3 Follow ups.

5) There are some mosquitoes in the restaurant.
6) Breakfast, Dinner Buffet spread could be better.
Other hotels like The Resident Tower, they have better buffet spread. Rooms also were very good and automated.
Finally it doesn’t feel like a 5 Star stay, other The Park hotels in AP, Telangana are better than this.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"- Mixed experience 
- Hotel is undergoing renovation, so smells of paint everywhere including the room. Noisy at most times. 
- The first room that we received was right next to the elevator that was under renovation, so it was extremely noisy. Switched to a different one, less noisy. 
- Pool was booked for a private event. So was closed. Here I thought I’m paying for all the amenities. 
- The bath tub was good. But the shower curtain wasn’t long enough to prevent the shower flooding the entire bathroom. Poor design.
- The A/C temperature setting is appropriate. I had to set at 18 C for it to feel like 24 C. It suddenly gets hot in the middle of the night. 
-Good staff, very pleasant to talk to. 
- We had dinner at restaurant 601. Buffet was decent.","March 24, 2025"

However, I was instead checked into a standard room, which did not meet my expectations or match the description of my original reservation.

Furthermore, I encountered several issues with the room and its cleanliness:
	1.	The room was not cleaned properly.
	2.	The bathroom’s shower area had a strong odor and was unpleasant to use.
	3.	Dusting in the room had not been done properly.
	4.	Water glasses were not cleaned adequately.
	5.	The minibar was not refilled , which was unexpected.
	6.	The bed linens were old and rough, detracting from my comfort.
	7.	There was no mirror in the room, requiring me to use the bathroom for dressing, which was highly inconvenient.

These issues significantly impacted my stay and did not reflect the quality I expect from your establishment. I kindly request the following actions:
	1.	An explanation for why I was downgraded from my original Queen Suite reservation.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"In no way it's a value for money for your stay.They charge you for 5 star hotel but is not even a 2 star hotel.The building is old, dilapidated and unimpressive.
 The reception lobby was full of mosquitos.The floor lobbies smell of old musty carpets. 
Rooms are old never been refurbished. Toilet fittings were rusted and jammed.

Even worse than everything else was the breakfast spread and area. Aqua seemed more like a pub than a breakfast area.Dark and dingy with a very small area for seating. Most of the tables were shaky and the staff didn't even bother to change or do something about it when told. The food was bad with very limited options.As a 5 star we expected a better spread of local delicacies. I had my doubts on the hygiene of the food.

The hotel needs a complete revamping and refurbishing. But they seem non bothered as they are banking on the location and corporate and group travellers ( towards whom the hotel and staff seem to have a better attitude because of the volume of business)

I booked the city view but the check-in staff didn’t care much and made a comment that they are all surrounded by the city.

Their on site gym facility was very nice. Aqua restaurant on site has below average food with some decent ambience and city views.

Overall, I was not happy with the cleanliness in the room. The dampness that we felt in the room due to low power exhaust system in the bathroom and overall old HVAC system.  There were uncleaned spots on the table so definitely raised questions on the cleanliness.  Bathroom is a worn out and very damp, can use a renovation. Beds are very small and not very comfy.

Didn’t have a good experience at the Leather bar which was on their premise. They were trying to manipulate the bill to evade taxes and it created so much confusion and the manager was selling it to me as if he was doing us a favor.","October 30, 2024"

The room bathroom was dirty and the glass doors had stains and water spots. The bidet spray tube was very tight and did not move easily. The room had multiple places where there were gaping holes in the wall(easily fixable with a bit of cement). The TV did not work and the phone receiver actually had nasty stains. The room had a weird odor and I took pictures of everything. When I shared with the manager he apologized but did nothing. Told him that I expect at least the Housekeeping manager to contact me but no one did. I got an email from the park asking for my feedback/ survey and it’s been a week with no response.

Whether it was a request for assistance or a simple inquiry, it felt like pulling teeth to get any sort of help. In the end, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had overpaid for an underwhelming experience. For those seeking true luxury and attentive service, The Park Chennai falls short and simply isn't worth the high cost. The positive ratings and reviews seems to be not genuine.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"unfortunately, my experience fell far short of expectations.

Upon arrival, I was dismayed to discover that despite booking a twin sharing room, I was allocated a queen bed room instead. This oversight was compounded by the absence of basic in room amenities which are standard offerings at most properties.

Furthermore, the self-check-in process left much to be desired, I found myself bewildered by the lack of assistance from the hotel staff.

Overall, my stay at The park was marred by a disappointing level of service and attention to detail. I had anticipated a luxurious experience befitting a property like this, but unfortunately, this was not the case.

I sincerely hope that the management of the Park takes these concerns seriously and implements necessary improvements to ensure a more satisfactory experience for future guests.

I booked two rooms for 2 adult and 2 kid they showed in the booking only 2 adult and also why would I book two room for two adult it is not understood and I was explaining and that could have been solved by check in my rooms and they charged after taking two rooms extra bed that was not making any sense .

Service at restaurant is slow.  For three days, I met a mom with a young kid struggling at the restaurant buffet. Not a single staff came forward to help her out. 

Breakfast menu is the same almost everyday. Quite disappointing when we had 5 days of breakfast in the hotel and the choices were almost the same all five days. 

I have stayed in much smaller hotels where the staff spend time getting to know the guests and we felt more welcome.

This property was built by the Gemini Studio(old) group. You can notice the celluloid theme all over.  I requested higher floor rooms got only at 4th floor.  They have 9 floors. Room is excellent with rhe exceptions of TV programs did not work. There is loose power socket hanging from the wall/ not flush. I front desk staff need training on how to greet welcome and make the check in smooth. Thats the first impression or interactions guest will have. Food in the buffet was medicore rs 700/person. The property is located walkable from US consulate so a popular destination US bound Indian folks from southern states. The have a decent roof top pool, spa and gym  on 8th and 9th floor. Most of them clean and functional. Recommed getting a massage from the spa some of the best therapist i have seen.

This 5 star hotel does not have coffee/tea after 10am (after breakfast closes) not even if you are willing to pay extra.

Lunch time- whopping Rs.2300 which had only 3 options for vegetarian and ordering roti took 1 hour (with only 2 tables occupied at the time) 

I was asked to pay before I leave my lunch table- has anywhere ever heard of charging to the room?? 

Restaurant timings for lunch/breakfast etc, and charges- not mentioned /displayed anywhere at all. No concierge available in restaurant. 

Room was dirty, and I was given the room next to a room under maintenance, had sound of drills and strong smell of new paint. 

Upon checking out, when I requested hotel cab, and ready to pay - the answer I got was ""driver is not there"". No politeness, or that you can wait for some time etc. 

The staff is extremely rude, and does not care for hospitality. 

This hotel is near USA visa consulate, and that is why most people choose it, and in many cases the expenses are paid by individual's employer. 
Regardless, people come here only for a day or two, and focussed on their process more than caring for hospitality.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"I chose the park for my family stay after considering many other options based on my previous experience with them in a different property 

We booked 3 rooms for family.

A few points from our stay.

1. The checkin process took more than an hour and that too when no other customers were checking in..

2. The bellboy didn't even help carry the luggage in spite of seeing that we are a family and needed help..
But he was prompt in appearing at the right time after checkin.

3. Gave us rooms on different floors in spite of request. 

Had to request another room to help senior citizens as bathroom was not suitable for them.
Wall mixer was not working in one room. Had to use cold water.

4. Beds were too high for senior citizens to use.

5. The in-house landline was not working in one of the rooms.

Multiple calls to all the service lines went unanswered. No one picks up the line.

6. The AC was leaking in one of the rooms and flooded the area near the door and bathroom.

AC settings didnot work and made it very difficult to catch any sleep.

7. Went and complained to the reception on the next day and got a response from the manager who corrected some of the issues..

8. They changed our room the next day but promptly checkin another guest without repairing the AC.. 
The poor guest was complaining and cleaning the same flooding.

9. The mgr tried to make some amends.. but overall the experience was not good for the family.

Major issues.

A) The property has become old and many rooms are in disrepair.
A full fledged renovation is needed.

B) The team looks tired and is inadequately staffed.

C) Not family friendly.. 

D) Parking is a available, but an attendant is needed to manage better

E) Overall, I wouldn't recommend the hotel. There are many new hotels where at least the basic facilities would work.","July 22, 2024"

While climbing the staircase at Main Entrance, 1 Lady was holding the Wall to walk, which for this kind Category of Hotels should have installed with Handrails to cater for Elderly and Disabled Guest. While the Lady was walking she struggled and I rushed to held her and safely brought her to the door. THERE WAS 1 STAFFS WHO IS ADVISING THE LADY WHY YOU DID NOT USE THE RAMP TO WALK UP. What a joke of this Clown he is standing there and watching he should have informed them or at least go and assist her. I hope Park Hotel Management pay extra attention on their Staffs behavior's.

Had the breakfast buffet. It was good. Room was neat and clean and staff were polite and very helpful.

Drawbacks.... There was a poolside event on the 8th floor till five in the morning and it was really loud. We found ourselves waking up through the night. And we were on the second floor.

The pool was thus closed early so that was an inconvenience since we were really looking forward to swimming. In fact the reception told us the pool was open and when we got there all ready in swim gear, we heard it was closed early. Kids were very disappointed.

The bar rules are like an old army club, no shorts and sandals allowed for men. So couldn't do that either.

I am deeply disappointed with my experience. I had prebooked the Park for my future Chennai trip but I will make sure that I cancel it as I cannot deal with service like this.","April 20, 2024"

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"I arrived at 12:00 noon. They kept me saying that standard check-in time is 14:00hrs. I totally understand that. But in front of me, few other guests got check-in before 14:00hrs. At 13:30 when I asked also they refused to give me room. 13:45 they refused to give me room. 
Please don’t trust the photos they have posted. Those were probably 5-10yrs old photos. It’s truly a very old hotel now. While I was waiting for check-in, their Manager came & tried to trap me with their Loyalty program. Asking for ₹8,000 annual payment with some discount offers. After long wait, so called “STANDARD” time I got checked-in & I thought at least rooms will be “STANDARD” . But their rooms were also very old. I had to take my luggages myself to the room. Maximum TV channels were Tamil local channels. No foot mat were provided. Don’t expect a Hot water shower. It’s just slightly warm water. That’s it! I requested for an iron & iron board. Housekeeping just ignored. No hangers were provided. Just a hanging hooks inside the wardrobe. Never try their food from restaurant. It’s so much overpriced. I ordered a Chicken Tikka & Naan. I thought the Oder taker will suggest me for a gravy. But they sent just Tikka chicken pieces only. I was expecting Tikka Masala. 
I booked for 2 nights & thought to extend another 2 nights if I feel better. Lobby sofas were literally antique furniture. They promote FREE access to Pasha Club. But when I went, they informed me cover charge of INR 2200. Then I went to have a drink at their bar. For 30ml Bel Whiskey they charged ₹1150. Come on!
Next day I checked out & moved to another Hotel. Totally a miserable experience!","June 26, 2024"

If I have to give a genuine review,  no doubt ,I will look for the other options before confirming this Hotel. The Park Chennai needs renovation on a priority basis. Washroom’s are in a very -very bad conditions.  Washbasin taps are broken, was moving in 180 degree position. Water Leakage from the bottom of toilet seats gives very unhygienic feel and smells very  bad.
Room furniture is very out dated & polish is required on entire wooden furniture.
Also they have one night club called Pasha. 
Big thing is ,hotel in house single gentleman’s   are not allowed in side the night club . Single ladies/Girls are allowed ,no matter she is staying with hotel or not.
I was suggested to get some lady in order to enter the club.
After raising this issue with hire management by e-mail, for the last night I was given upgrade to one of the best room/ VIP room  @ The Park. 
I was denying for upgrade because I struggled for 3 nights at the hotel for small small things.
Thus upgrade to the best rooms was not much fascinating to me for just one night. I was requested a lot to accept the room upgrade by the senior officials at the hotel.
I will not change my reviews about this hotel just because of room upgrade. Guys please please double check and then book your stay. End of the day every one needs better place after a tiring day.","March 20, 2024"

Definitely not a 5 star hotel experience","March 17, 2024"
Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"In my previous review of the same hotel few days back I had mentioned a few points. All of that remains the same. Just that it all further deteriorated. 

Upon completing the feedback form provided by the hotel, I was approached by the House Keeping Executive. He patiently listened to all the suggestions I made and promptly suggested that I can be moved to a better room. Which made me believe that the room I was provided is indeed one of the worst rooms on the worst floor. I always wondered how they would treat a discounted booking done by a ""Local"" traveller. It is evident that the better rooms are reserved for specific people. 

This further worsened when none of the F&B issues I pointed were rectified just few hours after my meeting with the Executive. I walked in for breakfast and the issues were as is. No one to attend my table while certain preferential tables were attended promptly. My table was dirty, no cutlery,  no water and no glasses. I had to ask for tea twice and after 20 minutes I received it. 

To top this one of the front office officials had called me to find out whether the points I made were addresses, to which I had told him, it wasnt and the experience was bad. He had asked to meet me in person, while I was busy at that moment I had scheduled to meet him in 5 minutes. I reached the reception and asked for him, and they dint seem to know where he is and it has been over 5 hours I havent heard back from him. 

This just shows that the management of this hotel is very aloof. 

I would certainly not suggest this hotel to anyone.","March 18, 2024"
Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"From the outside this looks very posh and high class. Its at the heart of the city and very accessible to almost all key places. The amenities offered are also good. 

But the rooms are mediocre. The room curtains are old and unwashed. The floors are damaged and at certain places the wooden floors have puffed out. The bathroom towels are washed but very dirty looking. At times the water in the bathroom are dirty and un usable. The rooms AC is centralised, though there is a control panel in the room it seems useless, it gets very warm inside the comforter and there is no way you can reduce the temperature at the middle of the night. 

The restaurant felt very unwelcoming, the food service staff caters to only a few patrons, I had ordered dosa from the live counter once and never received it, while I could see everyone getting the same. Some guests are greeted and offered water as soon as they entered, I never got that even once.  The same is the case at the reception, very unwelcoming staff.

The house keeping staff at the floor are very prompt and welcoming. They are indeed much better at getting things done for you, in terms of water, new towels etc than calling the reception and getting it. 

Overall, if you are looking for a place thats close to the US embassy, go for it. But if you are here to relax there are much better places around this area.","March 16, 2024"

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is very close to the consulate, at a walkable distance. Its ok in terms of cleanliness. Not so great for its facilities and is a bit old and run-down. Service was terrible! I don't know if its because the booking was though Agoda i.e. not through them directly, but I saw an attitude in the staff right from the time of check-in.  Nobody bothered to get our luggage to the room, we had to go and request for it. Even then, the person there acted annoyed that we asked. 
Later we asked for two plates in the room and the person on the phone was quite rude and said that will cost you money. I was really surprised to hear that but I said ok, send me the plates anyway. They brought the plates after a wait, and within a few minutes the guy comes back and says they want me to pay immediately in cash! I said what was the hurry, I could have paid at the time of checkout, but they said that's not possible and insisted on paying right then.  I was quite annoyed and told the guy I am not going tp run away with their 90 Rupees! I know the hotels don't like us getting food from outside but there is nothing you can do about it, people will get food from where they like, you can't treat your guests like enemies for that!! Any idiot in the service industry knows that this 90 Rupees and the attitude is going to cost them much more. 
At the time of check-out, I called up from room for help with taking the luggage but no one turns up after 20 mins. So I walked down and there was this guy at the reception who looked a bit senior. The guy had too much attitude.  He was pretending to be busy and did not bother to talk to me for almost 5 mins though I was waiting there. Then finally he shows some gesture with his hands which I assumed was that he will send someone but no trace of anyone for half an hour. So I ended up taking my own luggage down and said goodbye and hope not to see you again! I don't think they cared though.","March 06, 2024"

When I visited them at 11.40AM they stated that I have to pay for early check-in. Even the manager was not professional. it was not worth for me to argue with them and paid them for early check-in. 
I checked-out of the hotel in 4 hours and took another room at another hotel. The customer service of the front office executive and the manager is not acceptable. Please stop recommending these kinds of hotels. More than the money it is the attitude of the staff.","September 06, 2024"

Its only the screen which blocks the view from the room. specially with the children, someone inside the bathroom can not use the bathroom without a security. I felt little weird on that side. The TV remote was broken and unable to change channels. The shower liner is so little to block the water and flow all over the bath and the last thing is the water clogging in the tub.  checkin/checkout process is fast.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"Greetings of the day,
Myself, Coming from an aviation industry
Have experienced different types of hotel’s across all over the country. This one hands down was one of the terrible experience.
Starting with, we had raised a query, one week prior for an early check-in, they said subjective to availability, And so on the day I reached chennai, called the hotel an hour prior and enquired about the early check-in,  they said give us a moment, we will call you right back, and they never did call us back, after a while we again called the  hotel, when asked about, they told you can come and we will figure out the room. Little did we know, what they meant by “figuring out”. So yeah we reached, we spoke to the person in the lobby, he was clueless we have come for a early check-in, and told us to just wait and he will come back shortly(jokes on you, if you trust them to come back to you, they never do) adding to the waiting, any 5 star hotel would treat their guest with at most care, here at park, they don’t necessarily fulfill any necessary requirements at all, by not offering any basic amenities such as water, juice or anything to the guest who just arrive at the hotel, neither there are porters to carry your baggage from the entrance of the hotel. So yeah I forgot to mention, we reached the hotel by 11, so around 11:20 we again went asked the lobby and so summarize in  short it was a never ending loop with agony till 1:30, when we finally got our room, by the time the lobby and the waiting area was filled with people. Next issue is going to be about in room services,
1) we asked shower cap, it took them 45 minutes to get it, got me thinking they manufacture or they buy the product, oh yes have called 6 times to get the shower cap. 
2) funny part it was a paid room for two, but all the amenities were for one😂
Thank got we got our own dental kits.
3) Asked for extra pillows during the night,
Sun rose really bright the next day, but the pillows never did arrive, damm sure ev","September 06, 2024"

I had my visa interview at 11 and I was at the hotel by 8:00 they refused to provide the room as they were full and after charging me extra they provided the room by 9:30. So be careful while checking in to this hotel.,"January 01, 2024"
Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"The first thing I found missing here, is the minimum courtesy,of any hospitality, is the staff should greet the guest, atleast when they meet them for first time. Many a times, I myself, greeted them twice to get a first response from them. The HR team or Management should address this first, to make it a better and Happy place for guests. This should start from the Valet or Security staff, as they are the first people you see. There's no cost for this, but would give a pleasant feeling for the incoming 'aliens'.
I should also write the bests of The Park. This is a very convenient location and at Heart of Chennai City. They serve a wide and variety of foods at breakfast. The ambience at Lobby is pleasing. Swimming pool is clean and is on roof top, spacious and well assisted. Rooms are quite spacious enough.
To repeat the non hospitable experiences, I greeted Good Morning to the person, standing at the breakfast restaurant, early morning. She didn't greet back, I repeated, then she did.","January 04, 2024"

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"Stayed for 2 days here for the US visa interview.  Check-in was delayed by nearly an hour (from 2PM to 3PM) and nearly made me panic as my biometric session was at 4PM. Still managed to get there on time. Front office staff Mr. Tanveer was very nice and offered to extend my check out by a similar duration. 
Morning breakfast was good but service was disappointing as no one brought side plates or cutlery to our table and none were available at the serving tables. But once it was brought to the attention of the F&B manager, things were taken care of. Food was decent though.
Water in the tub and pipes were dirty and looked like it was recycled. 
The big plus is it's just across the road from the consulate and barely a 3 min walk. This is the primary reason why I booked this place. 
Ancilliary staff like parking attendants, security staff were extremely courteous and extra helpful. Overall, I think I was disappointed because I expected a higher level of finesse from a popular 5 star hotel.","January 04, 2024"

There was some problem with the cleanliness of the room, we found a broken glass piece in the floor and my wife was hurt unfortunately, but the service staff resolved it quickly by assigning us a new room. Customer service staff was specially nice with my 1 year old and they kept him entertained whenever we were in the lobby. Specially he had fun time interacting with Geetanjali and Aradhana and they also took time in making sure our stay was pleasant. 
The breakfast was elaborate and fulfilling just like last time. I specially like the local flavors in it.

The first impression I got there talking to reception is they are worn out, I guess they are over loaded and supporting is understaffed. I asked for early check in they said its not available, fair enough I had to wait till 2:00pm , even at this time I had to fight with the already frustrated staff couple of times. The room I booked is not available, they ""upgraded"" to bigger room . I thought they were so considerate but when I went into the room its very small and queen size bed not of the requirements I notified them ahead. So I have to take their upgraded room. so far so good, the bath room is glass ones and no blinds. not sure how they were considerate with me with two kids to use such a facility. up on calling them couple of times they brought some brown sheets and made some patch ups.  the drawers were not good, the furniture was old and broken at places. overall bad","January 04, 2024"

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"If you have VISA work in US consulate chennai, then only choose this hotel as this is opposite to US consulate, hence very convenient. Otherwise, I won't recommend this hotel for business or pleasure stay. The room offered in start was very basic and suffocating. Bathrooms were leaking and stinging. They changed the room on our request. Next room was better than previous, although bathrooms were still stinging. The room facilities, wrt room charges, were so elementary. The Gym was basic. Overall, you will find way better facilities in similar room charge hotels. I am not comparing it with 5 stars like Marriott or Hilton. We opted for dinner & breakfast buffet in hotel but it was not impressive. The staff was not at all courteous, although chefs were greeting & offering services more diligently. Restaurant staff were rude to everyone, except foreigners. That hurt me when the citizens & foreigners get different treatment. Coming to food, it was just okay. Overall, average experience :(","December 26, 2023"
Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"The hotel Management needs to change their rules of Check-in time.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is basically a 4* and not exactly a 5* as the hotel claims. Rooms were pretty dated and the flooring in my rooms was a little uneven. 
Missing spray pipe in toilet, Indian hotel and not having it was a HUGE SURPRISE!!
Room was exceedingly cold even after AC adjustment, and we had to turn off and on leading to not a comfortable sleep. Bed was too soft, but OK.
Breakfast was very good.

Service: Was great. At 2 in the night my daughter had fever, requested Crocin. Got it.
Next day at breakfast, daughter was not eating well due to fever, the staff packed 3 slices of bread and butter jams.. very very thoughtful.
Staff at reception helped avail Ola Cab since we did not have data. Very helpful.
Got a couple of hours extra stay, was nice.

SUMMARY
All in all to summarise that the hotel was great to stay mainly due to the staff, although rooms were not bad though. 
Would definitely stay there again if I get to Chennai. 
Thanks.","November 08, 2023"

Bad shower taps, dirty cutlery, unclean shower curtains, terrible food presentation - I couldn't find a single thing that was acceptable when I stayed there a few days ago. Not one.

The room that I was given was filthy. 

The toilet cubicle had horrible stink; the wallpapers in the toilet area were damp, stained (brown and red) and peeling off. It was a nightmare going to the toilet. 

The bedsheet had stains on it (near the pillow side).

I wore a t shirt and pants but the guys at the entrance say  we cannot enter cos I'm wearing track pants. I got shocked cos they can't even differentiate between pants and track pants! And I'm not that stupid to wear track pants to club which I regularly go when I come to Chennai. We also shocked cos when we came to Chennai in august we stayed in this hotel and we went clubbing and I wore pants. They allowed. I don't know how's your rules and regulations. We try to explained to them but they just refused and ask us to see the manager. The worst part is we have brought our clients along.  We feel very bad cos was humiliated infront of our clients. It's really funny cos all the time I wear pants and suddenly say I'm wearing track pants. We went to see the manager and their explanation doesn't make sense at. They are not helpful at all. If really that's the case please put up the dress code signage or any changes so that people won't be disappointed when they want to enter the club.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"Though the location was quite central, and it was pretty easy to get cabs right outside the hotel, I don't think I would stay here again due to a few unpleasant events that occurred. When I was brought to my room, I noticed that the rooms were quite badly maintained & this was supposed to be the 'new' set of rooms but thankfully they managed to change me 2 another room within 10mins. On the 3rd day of my stay (I was booked in for 4days, fully paid in advance),I got back 2the hotel a little after 9pm & when I got 2 my room, I realized my card was not working so I went down to the reception & told them that I could not access my room. The receptionist then told me that I was due to check out that afternoon & they had been trying 2 call me the whole day & since I had prolonged my stay I will have to pay for an xtra night. After explaining 2 them that I am actually booked in for 4days & had already paid everything in advance, she was still VERY adamant that I was only booked in for 3days.I told her 2 kindly call Agoda and clarify this matter but she was adamant and told me 2 call them myself & clarify. By this time I was furious & felt that as a staff at the hotel she held no responsibility & had no initiative to ensure problems were ironed out properly but instead had asked a customer 2 'prove' 2 her that I had paid. Once I showed her my agoda receipt she acknowledged that they had done a mistake. I feel this is not how you treat a customer, especially when you don't take the initiative 2 clarify matters b4 accusing the customers of over-staying. And to make things worse,a few of my friends in the city mentioned that this hotel has a very bad reputation. As a single lady traveler, this will definitely be my last stay in this hotel.On the upside, the bellboy was very helpful (I regret that I had forgotten his name) and the bed at this hotel is very very comfortable!","September 22, 2023"

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"I recently stayed at The Park in Connaught Place, New Delhi, and my experience was far from what I expected from a reputed 5-star hotel. The first impression was marred by an overpowering and unpleasant perfume in the hotel corridors, which was so strong that it caused headaches. This necessitated a room change, but the issue persisted to a lesser degree on another floor.

The hotel's general upkeep also leaves much to be desired. The outdoor areas have cracked tiles, and the rooms feel outdated, lacking the modernity and elegance one would associate with a 5-star establishment. The room amenities were particularly disappointing. Basic inclusions like bathrobes and quality bottled water were missing, and the tap water provided was just RO water, not what one expects in a luxury hotel. The bathroom facilities were underwhelming and did not align with the luxurious experience typically associated with a 5-star rating.

Reflecting on my stay, it's clear that The Park has not kept up with the times. It has been 12 years since my last visit, and the decline in quality is evident. The hotel urgently needs an upgrade and renovation to restore its former glory.

The management should consider experiencing a stay in their hotel to understand the shortcomings firsthand. The quality of amenities and overall experience do not justify the high rates charged, aligning more with a 3-star hotel than a 5-star one. It's disappointing to see such a decline in standards, and I believe there should be a mechanism to reassess and downgrade hotel star ratings if they fail to maintain expected standards over the years.

In conclusion, my stay at The Park was underwhelming and did not meet the expectations set by its 5-star rating. Significant improvements are needed to justify its current pricing and rating.","June 13, 2023"

The staff at the front desk were not very welcoming and certainly not the most efficient. We ate at the Pan Asian restaurant and it was not bad but for the very poor fried rice. The room to the door was really tight and took several attempts to open. The desk felt like it might topple anytime. The toilet was quite badly maintained, one has to see it to believe it. The walls around the WC are not tiled and not so  pretty, don't know what top say about the hygiene. I just couldn't figure out the middle knob on the shower wall and made do with lukewarem water. The tolet linen left some to be desired in terms of smell and appeal. The large window had spotted glass that ruined the view.

Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"Stayed 1 night here because we extend our stay after 3 nights in previous 5 star hotel which sold out so came here and was surprised when I reach the hotel to see there was no one to welcome or doorman/staff standing outside to attend our luggage and for clearance, I had to walk in to the reception to inform and they send staff… the entrance staircase itself was dirty and dusty. Guess the hotel needs good maintenance keeping it clean for customer to feel welcome for a 5 star standard, otherwise the rooms were good and clean.","February 11, 2023"
Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"Was a very disappointing stay at The Park Chennai. I had to move rooms twice because they were unclean and very run-down. The ceiling light too gave way and fell on the floor. There were curry stains on the curtains. The walls were poorly maintained. Was very disappointed. Thankfully I was upgraded to the next category room which was decent to live in, but still had its shortcomings. Hope the management takes these seriously, as it is not in very good condition.","February 14, 2023"
Chennai,The Park Chennai,7947,5 stars out of 5,"Booked the hotel for three days with lots of expectations for a joyful family time. However, from check-in to check-out it was anything but pleasant. I had asked for non-smoking rooms in a non-smoking floor but the hotel gave me two rooms which are smoking rooms still reeking of strong cigarette smell. After much persuasion, we were moved to another floor which was no better. The floor reeked of cigarette smell and stale pungent smell. The rooms were ok. The next issue was abt breakfast.  Reception said its complementary but the restaurant said we had to pay before go and eat. It was somehow sorted out and i did pay for the breakfast. But it was unpleasant and rude. The staff could have made the stay more pleasant with proper care and dutiful approach.  Having said that, some junior staff were lot more pleasant and approachable but were unable to help. I am a regular visitor to chennai but will think really hard before booking this place. Maybe its not meant for family travellers.","February 08, 2023"

A special mention to Harish, Tamil, Asok, Sayed, and Raman for their outstanding service. While I couldn’t catch the names of the restaurant staff, they were equally fantastic.

2. I had my tailor to deliver my sewn outfits. Unfortunately he arrived after 10pm due to traffic. The reception made a big fuss of sending him up even after I inform them. I had to go down to fetch him and explain to them, I did not have any issue when I stayed in Residency Towers, infact the staff fetxhed my tailor to my room. They had so many stupid questions to ask me when I am paying for the room.
3. They dont have tissue paper in the room. I ask them for 3 days they did not even provide.
4. Staff not friendly and no initiatives.

Room service not delivered even was called. This was almost like 2-3 times before it got done. Sometimes not at all. It was annoying and frustrating.

The buffet was limited. Hot kitchen was non responsive till the food was close. How lone you you actually need to make an omelette. Not 5 mins. But here it's was almost 25. The system is flawed.

After few minutes there was no noise. but it again started, this time it was very loud. I called the reception again  at 3.00 AM and they gave me another room  immediately.

Chennai,Pharos Hotels,35944082,5 stars out of 5,"I don’t know where I start as my experience at this so called 5 Star Hotel was so pathetic. I’d booked a Suite room and two Deluxe Rooms. We were 6 adults and 3 Children. On reaching and checking in we were given keys of just the Suite Room and 1 Deluxe Room. On our request to bring in the baggage to the room the front desk agreed. We went to the rooms on our own no one to lead us. On entering the suite room everything seemed okay. One of the Deluxe room was adjacent to Suite Room and we’d access to Deluxe Room via the Suite Room which was the only good thing. We waited for nearly 30 mins but no one brought our baggage only after reminding them did they send across the baggage. We noticed that there were no Facial Tissues, nor face towels on asking the hotel staff they informed that the tissue will be provided only for suite room and not for the deluxe rooms. Which is ridiculous as it’s a basic need.  From the day 1 there was foul smell from the Deluxe room on asking the hotel Maintenance Guy he told us it’ll fade off soon and he seemed to have no clue about it.
Only after 4 hours were we given the Keys to the 2nd Deluxe Room. 
The Sheets were stained in the 2nd Deluxe Room and water was clogging in the Bath. On complaining we were told it’ll be fixed during the Room Service but it was the same till we checked out. Everything was supplied only on asking like the Iron Box and Iron Board, Fascial Tissue , Face Towel……
The Breakfast Buffet was also not appealing. Nothing great about the South Indian menu …..Idli was so hard on the 1st day of breakfast.  
On the whole this Hotel does not deserve to be called a 5 Star I doubt if it’s anywhere close to any Star Hotel.  The day we were checking out. It was we who called in to keep the Front Desk informed of our Checkout time. While checking out no one to ask for Feedback or to check regarding our stay at the Hotel. 
To sum up plz don’t have high expectations regarding this Hotel. Especially if you have already stayed at 5&","July 27, 2023"

Chennai,Pharos Hotels,35944082,5 stars out of 5,"It is a good, decent hotel with friendly staff. Good location, but since it is near a busy road, there is always a small jam during peak hours, morning, and evening right outside the hotel. So, plan your commutes early. 
Food: The breakfast spread is not too bad. But the menu is the same and  rotated every few days. The 2 hotel restaurants serve tasty food with a good menu though it is slightly expensive then outside, of course. The Mustard Bar & Restaurant is good with nice Bengali food. Reasonable alcohol menu, but the wine selection is limited to only 3 or 4 types for both white and red wine. It will be good to add both the both the restaurant's menu to the room service with direct lines. You must call these restaurants separately to order food, not part of the actual room service menu. The room service has a different menu that you must download using a QR code, which is in the room.  If you don't have a local number, the ordering is cumbersome.
Rooms: The rooms we stayed is clean and comfortable. The toilet is clean with standard toiletries. The Wi-Fi signal is not bad, though has some lag at times. The TV channel offering is wide since they subscribe to the satellite channels. But they did not offer a TV guide to tell which channels are available.  So, I had to scroll through 900+ channels to know which are subscribed and able to watch. The iron for ironing is bad. It leaks water. I still don't understand why hotels don't provide a good iron!
Housekeeping: The housekeeping staff are responsive, but they leave out replenishing items such as towels, bathroom slippers and floor towel, etc, after every housekeeping. Seems like they do not have a checklist.","October 14, 2023"

Chennai,"Taj Club House, Chennai",174425,5 stars out of 5,"On the night of February 7th, my wife and I arrived in Chennai and had a terrible experience at the security check after immigration. With only one scanner available for thousands of passengers, we were forced to wait in an extremely long queue before reaching the luggage area.

Our troubles didn’t end there—getting a taxi was another nightmare. We had to drag our luggage to a building several blocks away, where the situation resembled a chaotic fish market. Passengers were moving in all directions, trying to locate their pre-booked taxis or Ubers. The taxi pickup area was inside a multistory parking lot, and by the time we finally managed to get our Uber, we were completely exhausted and drenched in sweat. It was an extremely unpleasant arrival experience.

Upon reaching Taj Club House, our check-in process added to the frustration. Despite presenting our OCI cards, we were asked to fill out a detailed questionnaire, including information about our visit, travel plans, and duration of stay—questions that seemed irrelevant for a hotel check-in, especially after clearing immigration. When I questioned the staff about the necessity of these inquiries, they insisted they were simply following government regulations.

By 1 AM, the process felt more like an interrogation than a check-in, and I grew even more frustrated. At that moment, I felt that holding an OCI card carried no real value, as we were still being treated purely as foreign nationals. To make matters worse, we were assigned a smoking room, despite booking a non-smoking one.

Fortunately, Mr. Nazer (hope I got the name right) stepped in, reassigned us to the correct room, and helped us settle in. I later asked him to convey my apologies to the receptionist, as I realized she was simply following standard procedures. I sincerely hope the authorities re-evaluate their policies and treat OCI holders with the recognition they deserve as Overseas Citizens of India.

Despite the frustrating start, our four-day stay at the Taj Club House turned out to be a wonderful experience. The housekeeping staff was fantastic, ensuring cleanliness and comfort throughout. The breakfast spread was delicious, offering a wide variety of food, accompanied by beautiful live flute music—a perfect way to start the morning. Additionally, the security personnel at the entrance and the customer service team in the lobby were extremely courteous.

Kudos to the entire staff at Taj Club House for their excellent hospitality!","February 12, 2025"

Chennai,"Taj Club House, Chennai",174425,5 stars out of 5,"I checked in around 12.10 pm and they gave me the room check in was smooth. Now going in the room I noticed there was not hot water coming. I had to bathe with cold water. Then I saw the basin platform in the bathroom was broken I really felt bad to see this as I was staying in the Taj . The furniture was old. Really they have to look into this matter. 
I complained about the hot water and they said in 2 hrs. You will get hot water. After 3 hrs. I again asked about hot water and they said they have some problem with hot water and then when I checked muddy water started coming. Again I waited till 8.00 p.m they couldn't solve the problem. At 10.30 pm I asked them to change my room but they said all the rooms have muddy water and it was not hot at all. They promised me that in morning I will get hot water and clear water but then again just the same. They could clear the matter only after 24 hrs. 
At night after 10.30 pm when I wanted to sleep I could clearly listen people talking from the room nearby. The noise reduction in room was poor may be due to thin walls. I could also hear the water running from the next rooms bathroom when they used it. 
The breakfast choice was of 4 star standard. Not at all a five star standard. I didn't expect this from a Taj hotel. 
The bakery section was just ok. The crossaint, Danish pastry were not fresh as they were to dry and hard to eat. There was no cheese in breakfast where other hotels of this standard have 3 to 4 varieties of cheese. Only 2 dishes of nonveg. 
So I was not satisfied staying in this hotel even being a Taj group.
The swimming pool was nice
Ac in the room was nice and efficient 
Bed linens and towels were good. 
Room service was not good. There was no comb, no shaving kit available in the room so I asked for it and even after 30 minutes I didn't get it. 
So all in all just a ok experience.  The location is good as just in walking distance there is a nice mall named EV  mall and nice restaurants to have food outside hotel.","February 07, 2025"

Not only that, they upgraded the room to a suite, as well! The staff went out of their way to accomodate our requests and made us feel as a part of their family. They provided a wonderful cake, bouquet, chocolates, baloons and a card, in-room, for my birthday by none other than the GM and his remarkable team. On leaving the room and returning, one will find that everything has been spruced up and refilled, without you even noticing! I have stayed in multiple hotels throughout my life, both in India and abroad but none of them come close to the level of hospitality that the Taj Clubhouse exudes.

Chennai,"Taj Club House, Chennai",174425,5 stars out of 5,"Restaurant, room service and housekeeping were very good. Very disappointed with rigidness of request and exorbitant laundry charges.
As I had a midnight flight to catch on 28 Feb, I requested for late check out at 8pm and agreed to pay half day charges as requested even though it was only 6 hrs away from the usual check out time of 12pm. I was told that the latest I need to check out is 6pm.To me half day means 12 hrs and to add, I checked in late at 9.30pm on 25 Feb for which I paid a full day room rates to be fair to the hotel. I believe some flexibility could be exercised as the request was only for an additional one or 2 hours.
Next, I had to pay 54 Singapore dollars for 10 pcs of mixed clothing for laundry which is equivalent to almost half day room rates. My feedback would be that the hotel to be upfront with laundry charges by placing a rates list according to type of clothing in the rooms. This would be fair to guests to make their choice in proceeding with their laundry request. Thank you. Maidin","February 17, 2023"

Dinner though it was a preset alacart, was super good. However, we were disappointed with the breakfast (taste to be specific).. not at the level of Taj for sure.

And my daughter and I were also pleasantly surprised to see an ‘eat smart’ option with our meals. The rooms were comfortable and elegant. But the highlight of our stay at the hotel has to be the attentiveness displayed by the staff. From the beginning of our stay (an early morning check in) the staff was quick and extremely accommodating. A special mention to Ms Rajeshwari who took care of us so well and who also guided us with our shopping. She really went out of her way to help us enjoy our trip. Mr Khan was also very helpful, organizing our transport and helping us with the language barrier. In general everyone was polite and helpful, from the waiters to those carrying our bags.

Sreekanth and Mahesh from Travel desk too were very courteous and made travel arrangements for us within the city very well.

Chennai,"Taj Club House, Chennai",174425,5 stars out of 5,"Depois de 30 horas de viagem, cheguei com o grupo no hotel as 3 da manhã e estava tendo, no térreo, uma festa jovem e muito barulhenta. perguntei na recepção, antes de subir se o som chegava nos quartos e o atendente disse que não. O checkin foi confuso por causa da altura da música
Quando chegamos no quarto o som era muito alto. Seria imposs´ˆivel  dormir
Falei com o carregador de malas que não poderíamos ficar naquele quarto e foi ele quem nos conseguiu um outro quarto, esse, sim, sem o som da tal festa. Outras pessoas do grupo que reclamaram, também foram atendidas por esse mesmo rapaz e transferidas para um quarto sem barulho
Ele foi gentil e solícito
Mas, tenho duas perguntas:
1.  porque o atendente não nos colocou diretamente em um quarto sem barulho?
2. Um hotel deveria se preocupar com respeitar o sono de seus hóspedes, já que é para isso que existem, a princípio...parece impróprio festas com som alto que perturbem o sono dos hóspedes. A administração não teria que se preocupar com isso? No meu cas, deu tudo certo, mas espero que chegue o restante do grupo. Ao todo seremos 18 pessoas, de vários lugares do mundo. Precisamos descansar depois de longas viagens. Ser´á que o hotel tem quartos silenciosos suficientes? 
De resto nenhuma queixa, só elogios...apesar que considero essa queixa bem importante...",

Chennai,Pullman Chennai Anna Salai,215811,5 stars out of 5,Hotel is undergoing renovations which is widely publicised on website however the inconvenience to guests is not reflective in its price. Rather the hotel should close down and open fully after renovations.   During check in guests were not advised of available amenities that could instead be used at their sister hotel and that the hotel provides a shuttle service.   We stayed during Christmas however the hotel made little effort to show the spirit of Christmas like it used to in the past. This was my fourth stay at the hotel and did not enjoy it at all.

Chennai,Pullman Chennai Anna Salai,215811,5 stars out of 5,"Breakfast is sumptuous with a huge variety of food items. Since it was my first time in South India, I stuck to the regional cuisine which was very well prepared. For dinner we had the South Indian Thali, prepared by Mr. Ram Dass, a master chef. Food was delicately spiced and easily the best South Indian food I have ever had. Rooms are spacious and air conditioning controls are by the bed side. AC is very effective. Bathroom had both 120 and 220 V sockets. Shower was overhead as well as hand held. Hotel is located within 5-8 minutes walking distance from the metro station and is also close to T Nagar which is a big shopping area. Staff was very helpful and organized our taxi to Mahabalipuram within minutes.  There is a rooftop swimming pool and gym. Cost wise, it is cheaper than a motel in USA and definitely value for money. The only negative point I can think of was the rather bright blue night light in the room. I highly recommend The Raintree if you come to Chennai.","January 11, 2020"

The breakfast buffet had a wide variety of food from traditional and western food with fresh juices and dosa and eggs made on site to order. It was a feast for the price of less than INR 1,000!!!! The 1st floor has a smoking lounge,but unfortunately it closes at 10pm due to security reasons, which made it a little inconvenient to have a smoke after that time.

I told this staff at reception its 17th March if he is saying booking is 17th March. Then he says you pay another 5 thousand rupees because its too early.  I refused to pay and argued that I should have been notified either by text message via my mobile phone or a call or an email so that I would have been prepared. Not arriving at the hotel and saying no its too early to check in. Even though I placed a special request while booing through agoda. No one bothered to look at the request.  At 2 am in the morning I had to look for another accomodation with my daughter.
I rang Agoda and they were told by hotel that there was NO Room....when initially staff at reception counter asked me to pay another 5 thousand rupees  for early check in.  this is not acceptable at all.

In the end after a lengthy discussion with the staff it was resolved. This happened on both occasions, Luckily I had the invoice in hand to prove my point.
When I was checked out on 26 Aug 2018, I requested for the use of the weighing scale to weigh my luggage and was told that the only weighing scale they had is spoilt and unusable.  These are the only gripes I have but overall this hotel is value for money.

My nearest option was farther away from the place of my business, for which I was visiting. I had my parents meet up with me, who hasn't seen me in 11 years except through Skype. My parent's are old, and I wanted to give them the best hotel experience.

During my stay, my TV had no signal, and the wi-fi never worked. Granted I arrived 1 day after a cyclone storm. I was told the city never had experienced one like that ever, and all of their services were down. Though this was disappointing, and took away any chance I had to login to my accounts and needs for my visit, it gave us all opportunities to catch up and share. I had search for hours in a city that I am not familiar to find a small internet cafe and print shop for many of my on-line needs or go to the airport to use wi-fi every day.

I had my hotel send someone to come pick me up at the airport, bless that guy, he waited 6+ hours outside.

The restaurants at this hotel, and all their food was just excellent. They get 5 stars for the all the menus and preparation. Your restaurateurs are excusably indulgent in giving you the best breakfast, lunch and dinner possible, and there were always plenty to choose from.

The hotel is very modern and great for ""Westerners"" and they have a great menu at all times. Be careful as Food and advertised prices in room service or Restaurant DO NOT show Vat tax, Luxury tax, Hotel tax etc. My suggestion is buy chocolates,drinks,nuts,chips etc outside and bring back to your room as you'll be paying 3/4 less than what you would. Also get a room in east wing away from Upstairs Disco/Bar as very loud bass music till late hours on Fri-Sun nights.Other than that it is a Good Hotel with Great Staff and I give it a 8 out of 10.","March 18, 2017"

The staff were amazing - everyone was friendly, service w a smile. Right from check in, room service, morning breakfast, security - everyone was good.

The rooms were amazing, TV channels availability was good, the room service food and drinks were great. Ordering late night meals to early morning coffee was a great experience. 

The room was amazingly comfortable; one thing missing was a digital clock in the room. Difficult to tell the time unless you look at your own gadgets. Internet was slow for work purpose but I managed through. 

Will def be staying here again and will be recommending the hotel to friends and family

Chennai,Pullman Chennai Anna Salai,215811,5 stars out of 5,"We came to refer to this hotel as the ""Sorry Sir"" hotel. At present, the front of this hotel in Chennai resembles a disaster zone with the building of the Chennai metro. You walk out the front driveway and you are greeted with dust, noise, congested streets and if it has been raining - mud. Check in was laborious - there was not enough staff to handle the few guests that were lined up. At one stage, I was told ""Sorry Sir"" and asked to take a seat and join the cue sitting in the lounge area. The room itself was lovely but the card room keys continually failed and I was told ""Sorry Sir"" you must be keeping the card too close to your mobile phone. I explained that my mobile had been locked in the room safe since arrival - but the receptionist told me that this could not be the case. We dined most nights in the hotel restaurants - the Thali meal there was a standout. There was one occasion, however, when a restaurant staff member noticed some food that had fallen from another table. He kicked the food pieces across the walkway so that it landed underneath a service area. When I asked him why he did this, he said ""Sorry Sir"" I didn't want anyone to fall!! "" There was one case where we paid for a meal with cash and they tried to charge us again for it stating that I could not have a copy of the cash receipt. When I told the employee that it was my receipt for a cash payment, he stated ""Sorry Sir - I was unaware that you had paid your bill."" In summary, the hotel  itself is fine as long as you do not have to deal with some of the staff.","June 20, 2018"

The rooms were inviting, the toiletries were of very good quality and the housekeeping staff were diligent and polite. But there are a few things to improve...

* When checking in, the reception staff inform guests of offers for their buffet dinner and other services. That is fine but not when we are in a hurry or where the guests are dead tired at 11 PM in the night. So they need to employ some logic here instead of rattling off.

* The hotel follows a 12 PM checkout policy. We checked in at 11 PM two days back and had requested for a late checkout at 7 PM. They extended it till 4 PM but were not flexible in not extending it further. I understand this if their occupancy is almost full but that was not the case. Considering the fact that this is a repeat stay they should have been more accommodating. I have experienced many hotels who were more than happy to do it.

* There are communication gaps between their various departments. I made a booking for two, but only one set of toiletries were there. I had to wait to get an additional toothbrush.

* Their restaurant service might be slow at times. I had to wait to get a glass of water even after being seated at the table for quite some time.

Overall its a good hotel but they need to iron out some gaps as mentioned above.","February 01, 2016"

One very bad point about this hotel is its ever-congested traffic due to the on-going metro works. Despite located in the city centre along the main artery (Anna Salai), be prepared to take at least an hour or two to travel back to hotel.

Chennai,Pullman Chennai Anna Salai,215811,5 stars out of 5,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Raintree during my visit to Chennai, and I must say that it exceeded my expectations in many ways. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was greeted with warm smiles and impeccable service, setting the tone for a delightful stay.

The hotel's location in the heart of Chennai was ideal, as it provided easy access to major attractions, shopping centers, and business districts. Additionally, the proximity to the airport made it convenient for both leisure and business travelers.

The rooms at Hotel Raintree were spacious, elegantly designed, and equipped with modern amenities. The comfortable beds ensured a restful sleep, while the well-appointed bathrooms offered a luxurious experience. The cleanliness and attention to detail were commendable, making me feel right at home.

One of the highlights of my stay was the exceptional dining experience at the hotel's restaurant. The menu offered a wide range of delectable dishes, both local and international, prepared with finesse and using fresh ingredients. The attentive staff provided excellent recommendations and ensured that every meal was a memorable one.

The hotel's facilities were top-notch, catering to the needs of all guests. The fitness center was well-equipped, allowing me to maintain my workout routine. The rooftop swimming pool provided a serene escape from the bustling city, offering panoramic views of Chennai. The business center was also well-equipped, making it convenient for business travelers like myself.

What truly set Hotel Raintree apart was the exceptional service provided by the staff. From the front desk to the housekeeping team, everyone was friendly, professional, and went above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay. They were always ready to assist with any queries or requests, making me feel valued as a guest.
