Although, we had read lot of reviews and photos of the same, we thought it‚Äôs one of the case and decided to give it a try but was highly disappointed to experience it. Tiamo restaurant on the 3rd floor is equally bad in terms of their services, it was our anniversary and I had requested set the table for us both but they had us change the table several times because of the leaking patios, later they cut the cake to compensate, Honestly, which was not necessary.

The pool is great, it is heated and the surroundings are lush green despite being on a higher floor.

We checked in to realize the Room was set for a single occupancy, one Bathroom slippers and bath towel, one Robe, a lot of toiletries were not even placed. Seemed like the Room was not even ready for check in. we kept calling for bath towels for hours before we could get it. Front Desk / reception cant care less. they were completely nonchalant and would not even care even when thy got multiple calls for basic things that are expected in the room. which we finally got after 3/4 hrs of been checked in Mini bar was completely empty too. the Rooms are nice and comfortable, but extremely poor staff made us rethink our decision about choosing the property. Taj in Bangalore is a wayyy better choice. the housekeeping manager was the only person who finally tried to make up for the issues. and payed heed to the problems we faced. thanks to him, we could finally be comfortable.

No hair dryer, only one bathrobe and the room service was slow at times. The pool area was restricted due to a private event and I wasn't even informed about this during check-in.

Bengalore,Conrad Bengaluru Reviews,4413696,N/A,"Made a booking well in advance for a  half-board stay, non-smoking room, paid extra for a lake view room with  bath tub facility on a higher floor . 

At 3 PM we were informed that our room was not ready (which is the standard check-in time). They instead offered us a  smoking room on higher floor OR a room on a lower floor without the bathtub OR asked us to wait for an hour for the room to get ready. We decided to wait and in the meantime the staff offered us snacks at the restaurant which was also delayed. 

Finally we got our room around 5 pm and to our disappointment the bathroom had a very stinky pukish kind of smell. On informing the reception they sent the housekeeping staff to check the bathroom. The staff confirmed there was a stink in the bathroom. They tried cleaning it up and changed the rug but it wasn't very helpful. We requested to move to another clean and sanitised room to which the manager informed that they were fully booked as there was a wedding happening in the premises. We were given an option to settle in where we are OR downgrade to the room without the facilities we had payed for (which seemed totally unfair).  

We had a long day and were tired from our travels. With no option being offered but to accept what was in front of us since we had already paid for it,  we were left with no choice.   We agreed to stay in the same room after getting the bathroom cleaned one more time.

We were offered to move to another room at 8 pm which we accepted coz the stink was persistent even after cleaning multiple times. 

The new room offered to us was clean with a good lake view. However the pillows were not fluffy and were very uncomfortable. We asked for new pillows which weren't any better. 

The food spread at the restaurant was very limited. Offered same choices for 2 consecutive breakfast and dinners . Although the restaurant staff was very hardworking and provided prompt service.

Bengalore,JW Marriott Bengaluru Prestige Golfshire Resort & Spa Reviews,30970094,N/A,"Stayed here for a couple of nights and have to say that the hotel, rooms and property is well maintained and extremely clean. Defenitely well worth the stay.

I have to say that the service provided by Shreya at the front desk was amazing,  simply first class.  I have never been treated this well in my life by any hotel. Thank you very much Shreya. 

Minor Feedback is around the walking path - lots of the bricks are not well placed and easy to trip at night.  May be better having a seperate walking path that is not shared by the buggies. 
Also staff for lunch at the aviary are not very attentive (waiting or chefs) only when there is no management around. 

I will definitely return for a longer stay.  Thank you Shreya and all staff at JW Marriott.","February 14, 2023"

Even though I mentioned I am here with a 3 year old who is hungry m, they delivered the khichdi in 2 hours. Also, I ordered for vegetable khichdi while they delivered slightly burnt plain khichdi. We did not have the patience to reorder, hence just adjusted with it. The canvas painting was a mela. When we went to the family area and requested for t-shirt/ bottle painting, the person there was not interested. K had to talk to someone senior to accommodate the request. They were showing off as if they will help but no help was provided.","October 03, 2023"
