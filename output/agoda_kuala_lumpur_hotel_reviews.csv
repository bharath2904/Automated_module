For Muslim Guests, U need to  re check the Qiblat. 
In near future, Hope the management can provide 1 or 2 Floor for smokers (We had to go down and smoking and a bit tiring for up n down). 
Also, for Qiblat signage ( need to re check with JAIWP or JAIS) and Carpet in the rooms need to wash regularly.. As for me, I can't sleep well due to my sinus ( as I was sensitive with dust). 
Lastly, need more varieties of TV  channel especially News.

Kuala lumpur,Seri Pacific Hotel Kuala Lumpur,10422,5 stars out of 5,"I was standing in what I thought was a queue only to be cut twice and the staff didn't seem to be bothered to ask who's actually next. Didn't mean to make a fuss but I thought a 5 star establishment shouldn't have missed something so basic.

I booked for a smoking room but was told on check-in that all rooms were non-smoking. No complaint about the room though you could tell the mattress had seen better days from the way it sinks in the middle. But the sheets, the down pillows and the room in general felt clean and fresh.

If you plan to use the sauna and gym be prepared to pay for the drinking water.","April 21, 2025"

Kuala lumpur,Seri Pacific Hotel Kuala Lumpur,10422,5 stars out of 5,"20 years ago this was an excellent hotel with world class service and breakfast. This visit the corridor was smelly and so was the room. The bedlinen had staining. One rather old towel per person.  The internet was very slow. Breakfast was unpleasant. The hot food was not hot and it was very crowded. There was a long queue for coffee. We left and had breakfast in the mall.
The staff could not initially find my pre-paid booking, and this was eventually resolved, but we were not shown any hospitality while we waited.","April 11, 2025"

Kuala lumpur,Seri Pacific Hotel Kuala Lumpur,10422,5 stars out of 5,"I decided to stay at this hotel after a tiring shopping trip for school uniforms at SOGO. Taking the LRT to this hotel from Bandaraya Station was very convenient.

I had a fantastic stay . The room was nice and spacious, with all the necessities you’d expect from a 5-star property. The bathroom was clean and had a pleasant fragrance, which made it even more relaxing. The mattress was soft, and the pillow was incredibly fluffy, ensuring a great night’s sleep.

Check-in and check-out were quick and seamless, which I really appreciated. The staff were exceptionally friendly, always ready to assist with a smile. The hotel’s location is also an added advantage, being very close to Sunway Putra Mall and the LRT station, making it super convenient to explore the area.

Additionally, there was a great variety of TV channels to choose from, perfect for winding down after a busy day. Overall, a very pleasant and enjoyable stay!","April 08, 2025"

Kuala lumpur,Soho Suites KLCC by Leala,2320473,5 stars out of 5,"Tôi đặt 1 phòng suite 2 bedrooms cho 5 người. Lúc đặt thì trong options có bồn tắm nhưng khi nhận chỉ có 1 bathroom vòi sen nên 5 người thay phiên nhau tắm hơi bất tiện. Phòng có nhiều ổ cắm nhưng chỉ có 3 cái sử dụng đc. Tuy nhiên ngoài hai vấn đề đó ra thì tất cả đều rất tuyệt vời. Chỉ mất có 10p đi bộ (qua cầu đi bộ có máy lạnh) là đến tháp đôi,15p là đến pavillion. Toà nhà có hồ bơi rộng view đẹp,có cả xông hơi. Phòng có đầy đủ dụng cụ bếp núc,máy giặt máy sấy sử dụng tốt. Đặc biệt chủ căn hộ rất chu đáo, ngày nào cũng nt hỏi có cần dùng thêm khăn or dọn phòng ko (free all service),khi checkout bạn tôi có để quên 1 cái áo cũng đc anh chủ nt báo. Staff cực kì thân thiện và chu đáo như a chủ. Nhất định sẽ quay lại đây ở nếu có đến KL lần nữa.","April 26, 2025"
