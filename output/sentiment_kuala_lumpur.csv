Zenith Hotel Putrajaya,5 stars out of 5,"Had a short stay of one night due to an emergency situation at home. The accommodation itself was nice. No major issues except the provision for shower gel could have been better. One miserable tiny cheap bottle of shower gel did not cut it for a hotel with a nice view of the Putrajaya lake. The rickety chaise lounge needed some TLC too. But the biggest disappointment was the F & B. Food was terrible. Not tasty at all. But the restaurant had a very  nice view of the lake. This was a major let down. Imagine if you just want to enjoy the hotel and stay in or simply want to dine in. This is the place to avoid for the food. I ordered nasi goreng, alio oglio, seafood hor fun and chicken tenders with some chilli dip. Imagine - only the chicken tenders (which is finger food as straight from frozen packets) was OK. The chilli dip was good. That was it. The rest was tasteless and for that you need to pay close to RM450 for 4 pax meal. In my view, its not even worth RM50 of any customer's money.

We love the spacious room and bathroom. The day and night view from the room is spectacular.  

We came during Ramadan, so adults went for suhoor and kids go for the usual breakfast. Options for suhoor is less than what was served during breakfast. I think the spread should be the same for both as we are paying the same amount. Nonetheless, we are still satisfied with what we've paid for as the food was delicious and there were variety of options.

Zenith Hotel Putrajaya,5 stars out of 5,"I recently stayed at Zenith Putrajaya in a Deluxe King Room, and overall, my experience was a mix of positives and areas for improvement.

Starting with the location, it’s fantastic. It’s right next to a water taxi stop, which makes for a lovely and convenient way to explore the area after breakfast. The ambiance and decor of the hotel are nice, and the room itself is fairly soundproof, which was a big plus for me. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, ensuring a good night's sleep.

However, I was a bit disappointed with the cleanliness of the room. I noticed yellowish stains in the toilet, which seemed like they hadn't been scrubbed in a while. Additionally, there were hairs left by previous guests on the floor, and the furniture was quite dusty. For a hotel of this caliber, I was expecting better attention to detail in this area.

The check-in and check-out process went smoothly, but the counter for check-in felt a bit cramped. There are four counters overall, so it didn’t take long, but it could be more spacious. Some of the staff were friendly, but others didn't provide the warmest service, which was a bit inconsistent.

Parking is another thing to keep in mind. It was quite limited during my stay because there was a running event happening nearby. This made finding a parking spot a bit tricky, so I recommend arriving early if you're driving.

As for the breakfast, the buffet was a bit underwhelming in terms of variety. The nasi lemak sambal, in particular, was quite disappointing. The overall selection was decent but not spectacular.

Despite the cleanliness issues, limited parking, and some mixed staff interactions, I would still recommend this hotel due to its excellent location and comfortable room. With some improvements in cleanliness and service, it could easily be a top-tier option in the area.","It’s right next to a water taxi stop, which makes for a lovely and convenient way to explore the area after breakfast",0.0031,0.0058,0.0755,0.5181,0.3974,4.3009,3f

Sunway Putra Hotel Kuala Lumpur,5 stars out of 5,"Parking was adequate, you could always drive to the higher floors and there should be available lots there. Driving to the parking area is via a long spiral ramp which needs patience and focus but it is not exactly something to complain about. The parking system is great where the hotel personnel will update their records for a free and easy parking experience.

Hotel personnel are generally friendly and nice, service is good from front desk as well as housekeeping. Even though security guards look strict and a little unwelcoming (stood and stared at customers at the breakfast area) but it's not a big issue, they are probably just doing their jobs.

The hotel is connected to a mall which makes it very convenient for activities and some entertainment.

The swimming pool is nice, clean and fairly big. The gym was also good with a fair amount of equipment for various types of exercises. Towels and drinking water (dispenser) are provided.

Seri Pacific Hotel Kuala Lumpur,5 stars out of 5,"I had a disappointing experience staying at Seri Pacific Hotel. The property is visibly run-down and poorly maintained. Although there are five lifts, only three were operational during my stay. Due to the outdated lift system, only one elevator can move either up or down at a time, causing long waits and large crowds, especially during peak hours.

Parking is also inconvenient. The hotel offers only a single level of parking, which is typically full. Guests are usually directed to park at the PWTC carpark, where ticket validation is provided at RM5 per entry.

Upon entering my room, I was shocked to find a large black lizard on the floor—an unpleasant and unhygienic welcome. The bathtub was leaking and could not be filled properly. Housekeeping services are also disappointing: requesting a fresh towel incurs a RM20 charge, and the room comes with only two 500ml bottles of water. Additional water is charged at RM5 per bottle, with no water dispenser available, so I recommend purchasing bottled water from the nearby Sunway Putra Mall for better value. The phone is not working. You need to scan the QR code to reach out the customer service operator. The house keeping took 1.5 hours to deliver the fresh towels and water, despite numerous reminders. 

The breakfast buffet is average at best—filling, but none of the dishes stood out in taste or quality.

Overall, this hotel is not ideal for a staycation or business trip. There are no scenic views, the swimming pool is not well maintained, the rooms are not clean, and the elevator system is severely flawed. Additionally, the surroundinge area feels unsafe, with a visible presence of vagrants and loiterers.

Location wise is great. Near to LRT PWTC, next to Sunway Putra Mall. Breakfast spread is mid range. I think nasi lemak and the sambal is very nice. It has a lot of dessert from traditional kuih muih and cakes, they also have diet menu.
Definitely will come back here again.","Our room is spacious, complete with basic amenities, with separate shower and bathtub space",0.0017,0.0029,0.0377,0.414,0.5437,4.4951,2e_1

Soho Suites KLCC by Leala,5 stars out of 5,"It was a horrible, horrible stay. It was my first experience with canceling a booking. This review is going to be a lengthy one but I must share the horrible experience to warn other travelers about this place. 

First impression, I was very happy with the size of the suite and all the facilities.
But the nightmares began soon after. It started with a cabinet door that suddenly fell. I couldn't get the door hinges and screws to work at all. It seemed like the door was previously attached by gorilla tape as a temporary fix. Maintenence came to the room to fix it with more gorilla tape but failed. The guy took the cabinet door completely off instead. After that, there was the ant problem. There were so, so many ants roaming all over the kitchen area. This issue was dealt with rather quickly (ant poison was sprinkled all over). Therefore, I was pretty impressed with the customer service.

After a full day of city exploring in the blazing sun, I was looking forward to a bubble bath. That's when I noticed all the drain flies in the bathroom. I killed at least 6 flies during my very quick shower. There were many, many more drain flies in the bathroom. When I reported the problem, they suggested moving me to a room on the upper floor that had no insect problems.

After I stayed in the new room for a few minutes, I was scared and I begged them to move me back to the previous room. I felt horrible for asking but there was a very large patch of mold on the ceiling in the bathroom. The walls were moldy as well. Also, there was a horrendous amount of drain flies in the bathroom.

After I returned to the original room, I spotted many baby cockroaches. I didn't say anything to the hotel staff, I just couldn't wait to get out of there.

I was traveling on my own for the first two nights, and then my friend was going to join me. We have both decided to cancel the booking of this horrible place and look for another hotel/ b&b instead.

Facilities - Equipped with TV (Netflix, YouTube, Malaysian TV, hundreds of channels), microwave, stove, fridge, washing machine, dryer, iron & board, drying rack, ALL complete and labelled even!

Soho Suites KLCC by Leala,5 stars out of 5,"Honest review - Simply 10/10.

We arrived at Soho Suites at 10.30pm after a night flight, but the host JP had already been waiting in front of the building. Despite the late night he proceeded with a smooth check-in, helped with our luggage and explained all facilities.

Room - Ours was a 2-bedroom apartment with 1 bathroom. All rooms were SO clean I was really amazed. The living area was spacious as well.

Facilities - Equipped with TV (Netflix, YouTube, Malaysian TV, hundreds of channels), microwave, stove, fridge, washing machine, dryer, iron & board, drying rack, ALL complete and labelled even! So organised and easily used even without any manual. Pots and pans, cutlery, cups and plates, you name it. So so complete.

Toilet - Super clean, enough toilet rolls, towels, hand wash, shower gel and soap provided.

Imperial Lexis Kuala Lumpur,5 stars out of 5,"I stayed for two nights during a family trip. The user reviews before booking were very helpful, so I would like to write my detailed experience as well. The reasons I chose this hotel were the view from the room, the night view of the Twin Towers from the infinity pool, the sky bar and restaurant, the glass floor observation deck, and the gym – all of my preferences were met. To put it simply, it was a great decision and I strongly recommend this hotel to Japanese guests. Although my English is not very good, the staff were very friendly to us, and we hardly faced any difficulties. They also greeted us with a very cool traditional gesture of placing a hand on their heart, which seems to mean ""I show my sincere respect"" and ""I have sincerity towards you."" Therefore, I think Japanese people should not be shy and reciprocate in the same way. They will respond with a wonderful smile.

After arriving, show the Agoda reservation screen at the hotel’s entrance on the first floor. They smoothly took care of our luggage and guided us to the 8th floor main front without any bags. After that, while enjoying a welcome drink, we filled in our email address, phone number, and signature on a tablet and paid a deposit of 500 RM with cash or credit card. Then, we listened to the explanation for our stay, and that was it.

From the room on the 45th floor, the view of the Twin Towers and the cityscape in the distance is fantastic. There is a golf course behind the hotel, and we could see faraway mountains. The stylish interior gives a sense of cleanliness. The shower's water pressure and temperature were comfortable without any issues. The initial screen of the television also contained hotel information and facility guides, making it easy to look things up. It also had YouTube, which was great for watching Japanese news broadcasts.

The pool on the 51st floor did not seem crowded at all, as far as I could tell.

I had made a reservation for the sky bar on the 53rd floor in advance from Japan. As soon as I mentioned my name, they guided us right away. The breeze passing through felt nice, and we had a lovely time as a family. The dress code prohibits swimsuits, sandals, and caps. Fortunately, guests under 20 can enter until 9 PM, but since it's a place for adults to relax, I think it’s better suited for those in middle school and above.

Additionally, the breakfast here offers a variety of international dishes with many booths, which is truly wonderful. I highly recommend adding this to the service.

The area surrounding the hotel is safe. There are no traffic jams, and it is a bright, quiet high-rise hotel district. It’s within walking distance to the Petronas Twin Towers and the adjacent shopping mall Suria/ISETAN, allowing for a safe passage through the park. There’s also a 7-Eleven nearby, which is convenient (it may not show up on Google Maps since it just opened, so be cautious).

I’ve said a lot, but visiting an unfamiliar country can be very anxiety-inducing. However, this hotel provided a sense of security that alleviated those worries. When I go to Malaysia again, I will definitely stay here again. And I want to greet everyone properly. Please allow me to use that lovely gesture of placing a hand on my heart. Until then, I wish everyone good health!","The reasons I chose this hotel were the view from the room, the night view of the Twin Towers from the infinity pool, the sky bar and restaurant, the glass floor observation deck, and the gym – all of my preferences were met",0.0566,0.1183,0.2281,0.3653,0.2317,3.5972,6d_1

To our surprise, Lexis has gifted us with birthday cake and a complimentary birthday wish card. They have complimentary minibar as well. The shower water pressure was good! The private pool was awesome! Missed the chance to witness the KLCC tower view from the infinity pool at Level 51! Will definitely come back again just for the breathtaking view and experience!

Love the breakfast spread, so many variety of food options & unique. My kids definitely love the pool, good size however the water is too cold 🥶. I find the spa prices quite steep rm 420 which is more than triple from offered outside. Overall excellent stay .

Imperial Lexis Kuala Lumpur,5 stars out of 5,"A luxury 5 star hotel in the heart of Kula Lumpur with a pool inside all rooms. The service from concierge to reception to housekeeping to the restaurant is superb!!! I spend the whole day in the hotel itself to enjoy the facilities and the surroundings with the tip top services they have given. The view in the day and night are spectacular! 
Housekeeping with new sheets and towels daily makes it more hygiene. An umbrella for use at anytime. A small shopping bag to help you with the shopping as they moved towards sustainability, even water bottle are glass. House slipper and matching slippers! And last but not least, a great surprise of the fruit platter upon arrival in the room for my advance celebration for my wedding anniversary. I would come back for sure....

Imperial Lexis Kuala Lumpur,5 stars out of 5,"Newly built hotel right in the heart of KL - a drivew away from famous malls. Everything is new. Huge bedroom and bathroom but small living room & walk in wadrobe.

Swimming pool in the room is an awesome idea but it could be a hazard to young kids. The glass couldve been covered more towards the top instead of half.  Marble flooring is quite slippery when wet. No locks on shower area.  Should have some place to hang towels / wet clothes (after swim) 

I would say this room is more suitable for couples or families with no kids. Overall a great stay!",No locks on shower area,0.2637,0.2564,0.2592,0.1402,0.0805,2.5175,2e_1
Imperial Lexis Kuala Lumpur,5 stars out of 5,"Dgn hampir rm1500 semalam.  Maaf cakap tak berbaloi. Bole dpt hotel 5 star lain 3 malam stay.

Pro : Layanan staf terbaik. Check in dia Mai entertain kita.. welcome drink m towel basah. Tutur kata yg sopan. Joki valet parking terbaik.

Cons :  Bilik premium pool hadapi construction sebelah. Tp nk buat camna kan.
Ekon bilik tido tak sejuk spt diharapkan. 
Sabun n syampoo habis bila bgtau dorang cakap esok baru ada housekeeping dah balik. Ni agak sedih.  Mandi tak bersabun. Kalau rate below rm1kcm lexis Penang ok lagi ni 1.5k agak keras Dan tak berbaloi.",Joki valet parking terbaik,0.0056,0.0056,0.0241,0.1359,0.8288,4.7766,4h
Imperial Lexis Kuala Lumpur,5 stars out of 5,"Spent a night and I have not regret it since. From the moment we arrived, the staff was so polite, friendly and helpful. All smiles greeted us until we checked out. The rooms caught us by surprise. So luxurious especially the toilet. We were in awe. The breakfast spread was great not to mentioned the coffee house itself and a lot of varieties (foods). The pool in the room is quite big and can fit 4 adult easily.  Location wise it's not so near to KLCC nor Pavillion as you need to walk around 10-15 minutes. But since we are driving that is not an issue. Lastly, the skydeck and infinity pool just took our breath away with view. Especially at night. Simply superb. Uninterrupted view of KLCC and KL Tower. First time I have no complaint at all on our stay and will definitely come again. Lastly, special shout out to the staff Rizal (Chief Concierge). So very attentive and friendly.","Lastly, special shout out to the staff Rizal (Chief Concierge)",0.145,0.1419,0.1964,0.2657,0.251,3.3358,4i
