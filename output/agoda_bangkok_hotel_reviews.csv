Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"The lobby looks great but the hotel furnitures and fixtures in general are old and outdated. However, the staff are very friendly and helpful. Negative points for water supply and tv (need to get help to fix the hot water and tv signal). Plus points for buffet spread breakfast, great overall service and 7-ll just a minute walk away from the hotel entrance. A good location in town and it is lot along the main street.","May 11, 2025",11,May,2025

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"We really enjoyed our JCK experiences. This is a great hotel, especially for the money.  It is about the same distance from the Sukhumvit, Icon Siam, and Asiatic areas.
The Kevin has terriffic views of Bangkok, the Chao Prya river and its bridges as well, as very goood food though with this last trip, I was a bit dissappointed with the breakfast.
That said, the lobby cafe and the 37th floor bar are excellent and the food offerings were very good.
The rooms are specious, beds super comfy and the staff really care about you having the best experience possible. We will definately stay at the Kevin again soon!","May 10, 2025",10,May,2025

Locatie is niet super centraal maar dat wisten we vooraf. Er is een 7/11 om de hoek en met de grab waren we zo met de Sathorn pier of nightmarket. Zijn tip voor de hop on hop of boat was ideaal. De familiekamer was wat verouderd maar goed schoon gemaakt. Eigenlijk is het jammer dat ze de kamers (misschien nog) niet opknappen. Ontbijt was goed. Niet bijzonder.","May 06, 2025",6,May,2025

The hotel was affordable needs a renovation. as its pretty worn out. Lifts are extremely slow and often only 3 out of 4 would be working making it hard to get into one due to how many people are waiting.

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"We had a good stay at JC Kevin Sathorn, where the rooms are impressively spacious, featuring large balconies with scenic views. While the furniture could use some updates, the overall comfort and cleanliness made for an enjoyable experience.
One of the highlights was the rooftop bar, offering breathtaking 360-degree views of Bangkok—an unforgettable spot to celebrate New Year's Eve, which we truly enjoyed. The food options within the hotel are excellent, though it's worth noting that the surrounding area is more business-oriented, lacking a strong local vibe.
Service was a standout feature, with friendly and helpful staff, especially the night team, making our stay smooth. However, the reception can get quite busy, particularly with large groups of Chinese tourists. The elevators were frequently slow or out of service, which was inconvenient, but overall, we had a pleasant experience.
Would definitely recommend for comfort, great views, and solid in-house dining, but travelers should plan ahead if looking for a lively, local atmosphere.","April 28, 2025",28,April,2025

Plates and utensils were available, but only upon request. If the stove isn’t usable, a microwave should be provided as an alternative.

One noticeable issue was the air vents—they were quite dirty and could use some serious cleaning. On the positive side, the staff were very courteous and helpful, and housekeeping did an excellent job throughout my stay. With a few improvements, this place could be a much better value.","April 21, 2025",21,April,2025

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"The accommodation is really great for the price.

But after staying at this hotel for 4 nights, I felt something.

First of all, the room I was assigned was on the 6th floor.
But since the view was really bad, they moved me to the 10th floor, and I realized that white guests were assigned to floors above the 20th, while Chinese or Korean guests were assigned to floors 6-10, lol.

After checking in, I carried my family's luggage, but later I noticed they moved the luggage for me too, lol.

I've never seen a place where they just give you the key card without explaining where the breakfast place is or anything about the hotel.
The breakfast was completely awful, and I found a cockroach in the room.

Korean guests, please take this review into consideration
and ask to be moved to a higher floor if you are assigned to a lower one.
Please also ask them to carry your luggage and don't get taken advantage of, ㅠ

Other than that, it was mostly okay.
It takes about an hour to the airport in the morning.","April 13, 2025",13,April,2025
Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"JC Kevin is also my first choice coming to Thailand. Big room and a very reasonable price. Bed is comfy and hygiene ok.

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"This is a repeat visit, but this time we stayed with 16 family members for 8 nights. We arrived the day after the earthquake in Myanmar, and the guest elevator was not operational. Only the service and staff elevator was in service. Perhaps due to the earthquake's impact, cleaning the rooms could not be completed in time, so we couldn't check in, but the staff worked hard to assist us. However, we only received the last room after 8 PM. 
Hotel location: It takes about 8 to 10 minutes on foot from the nearest station, so it might be more convenient to use a taxi. There aren't many shops around. It's fine for those familiar with the area, but beginners may find it unsuitable. 
Room: Spacious and easy to use. It was good to have two toilets and shower rooms. Although there was a sink in the living room, there were no detergent, sponge, microwave, dishes, glasses, or kitchenware. 
Cleaning: Bed linen is not changed unless a request is made using the card provided. The trash that was dropped around the toilet and bath remained for 2 to 3 days, so I mentioned it to the reception on the fourth day. 
Breakfast: It was delicious, but the variety didn’t change much, so it got boring after 8 days. I think it was good to be in a quiet area near the expressway entrance. 
If I have the chance, I would like to stay again.","April 10, 2025",10,April,2025

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"This hotel has seen better days.
The whole hotel has wear and tear.
Its a cheap ""no name"" 5*, we are paying under 70€ per night, breakfast included. For that price it's pretty good. 
I was hoping for better, but not too surprised.
Its a ""off brand"" 5* so it doesn't have to live upto the standards of big chains. 
If you are expecting a luxury 5* experience and think you struck gold here, you are wrong. this is not for you. 
Go to a brand chain, even if its a 4* brand chain. 
If you are not that fussed about the small things this is a budget friendly higher end place. 
I saw some people reviewed the bedding was torn, ours was brand new, so some improvements are happening. 

Seeing the room it looked familiar, when I saw the pool area, it dawned on me I had been here before.

This used to be Radisson blu. I was here in 2010.

This was 15 years ago.... I loved the hotel back then, it was one of my first upscale 5* hotel experiences.

The room is exactly the same as back then, same furniture and everything. 
So it brought back memories, which was nice.

But everything has seen the 15 years of wear and tear. 

I think the staff are doing their best to keep the standards high, But if the owner doesn't want to refurbish the hotel, there is only so much that can be done. 

What I really liked, was there were a lot of young people here, having their first ""5*"" experience. It was great to see how excited they were. 

Unfortunately the room had a moldy smell, I guess during covid there was no aircon running and no one was airing out the rooms. 
We have been airing out in the evening and it seems to help. 
Aircon circulates and cools of the air in the room, so need to shut of the aircon once in a while and air out. 

What I liked now, was the heat and water pressure in the shower, It was the best shower I have had in 3 months. 

Breakfast was good, it was hectic. Somehow some people's mentality gets extra visible at included meals. 

There were actually two tv's when I was here last time, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Now there is only one. 
Have no idea how the one that is there now works, even with the instruction, laminated and placed beside.

All in all a good experience for the price.","March 05, 2025",5,March,2025

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"I had high expectations of this hotel but was disappointed that we were given a room with 2 single beds and low floor. I had received email confirmation from Agoda during booking that my king size bed & high floor requests were sent to hotel. But hotel told me instead that the agent did not state in the booking. Hotel told me they are fully booked and that’s the last room available so we had no choice but to take it :(

The tv system in the room is terrible, keep buffering every 2 seconds as it’s conducted to a really slow internet box. Even local channels has difficulty to see. We had to call the technician up who couldn’t do anything and in the end we gave up and switched off totally after 5 mins of intermittent transmissions.

This  hotel is nowhere near a 4 or 5-star standard. Should not have booked a suite room here in view of the room size","February 26, 2025",26,February,2025

On the last day, the toilet paper seemed to get stuck and wouldn’t flush, which was a bit of a problem, but I managed to solve it myself.

There are no dishes or cutlery other than glasses and coffee cups, and no microwave, but there is a larger refrigerator with a freezer.

Every day, there is a service of free 500ml bottled water.

As others have mentioned, it is about a 15-minute walk to the nearest station, but using Grab taxis makes it convenient for transportation.

We also enjoyed breakfast. We stayed for three nights, and there were 2-3 different items on the menu each day.

There were times when the TV didn't work, or there were no bath towels, but there were no particular issues as the front desk addressed things promptly when notified.

Each room has a large closet, and there are plenty of hangers provided, which was helpful.

It was disappointing that the rooftop bar was under construction and we couldn’t use it, but overall, I think it was a good hotel!","February 06, 2025",6,February,2025

Although it was kitchen-like, it did not have a warming function, just an electric kettle. There was a larger refrigerator. I thought I had booked with breakfast included, but I realized I had booked without breakfast, so every morning I bought fruit from the supermarket and stored it in the refrigerator, having meals in the room. It was great to be able to use the spacious room to its full extent. The nearest BTS station is about a 15-minute walk away, and there were several Seven-Eleven stores and restaurants along the way, so I could get takeout and eat in the room. 
I had trouble issuing my mother's boarding pass for the return flight on my smartphone, and the front desk printed it out for us, which was a great help. They also arranged a taxi to the airport; a regular taxi was 500 baht, and a larger taxi was 700 baht.

I requested daily housekeeping, and every time we returned, the unit was spotless, with freshly made beds. The staff also restocked water, coffee, tea, and sugar during cleaning, which was a nice touch.

The only minor downside is that the nearest BTS station is about 700 meters away, so there’s a bit of a walk. However, the doorman was incredibly helpful, assisting with taxis or Grab rides and even recommending places to visit.

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"So I booked this hotel because it seemed a modern hotel, with a rooftop and a swimming pool.

Unfortunately, the rooftop was under refurbishment when I stayed, so I could not access it. The room smelled bad because of a lack of aircon maintenance, my curtain and bedsheets had holes in it (!!!), and the rusty gym equipment held together using bandages. The room as a whole felt old and in need of a full refurb.

I gave management the opportunity to make it good, but the only improvement was a very similar room, still smelly but without holes in the curtains. I asked for a refurbished room but apparently these were at a premium I should have paid. All I got offered in the end was a non alcoholic drink voucher.

If you book this hotel you may get a four star experience if you're purchasing a premium room, otherwise you'll get a three star experience. The hotel isn't ideally located if you're a tourist, so you may have to factor in the taxi cost.

All in all I would not come back to this hotel, it's certainly the worst I came across over the past few years (and the reason why I wrote this review).","January 16, 2025",16,January,2025

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"Hotel Review

I recently stayed at this hotel for three days, and unfortunately, it was a very disappointing experience.

The issues started at check-in when the reception mistakenly gave me the access card to someone else’s room. Upon entering, I was shocked to find other guests already in the room, lying on the bed. This was a highly embarrassing and concerning situation. While the staff apologized and rectified the mistake, it’s hard to understand how such a significant error could happen.

Once I finally got my assigned room, the disappointment continued. The cleanliness was unacceptable—there was an oily and dirty tabletop, used tissues scattered on the floor, and the overall hygiene of the room left much to be desired. Additionally, the hallway carpets were stinky, which made the walk to and from the room unpleasant.

To make matters worse, the hotel lacked clear signage or directions for accessing the rooftop facilities, leaving me frustrated and unable to fully enjoy the amenities.

Lastly, the location is far from convenient for tourists. There’s nothing nearby to grab a quick bite or explore, which added unnecessary hassle during my stay.

Overall, my experience was far below expectations, and I would not recommend this hotel.","January 06, 2025",6,January,2025
Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"All in all a really nice Hotel.  Check in was easy and they allowed us early check in.  Disappointingly our room was a Twin when I had requested a King but as reception pointed out requests are not guaranteed.  Spacious well equipped room with small balcony.  Great well equipped, well run gym and 32 metre rather cold pool.  Not enough beds surrounding pool.   Breakfast was good with many choices but why not hot plates - hot food was warm at best.  Disappointed Zoom Bar and Sky Terrace was closed as this would have been a highlight - don’t know how long it is closed for.  Area is okay but not much choice for eating though not far to walk for BTS transport.  Very nearly an exceptional but a few things could have been improved.","January 04, 2025",4,January,2025

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"Just as another reviewer (I wish I saw their review before) I had high expectations with this hotel because it is supposedly a 5-star hotel. A good amount of people left reviews with high remarks! Which makes this so surprising. Pictures also made it look very high end, elegant and luxurious. 

This place is a total cat fish and to make matters worse this hotel stay was not cheap what so ever!The hotel entrance, lobby and first floor is up to date and sets the standard of a 5* luxury hotel. However, once you get past the first floor, you start seeing the other side of things. 

Rooms: We got a 2bd suite, the kitchen and living room area is nice but has a very old feel. Bedroom furniture (dresser), bathroom and balcony need to be updated, they are very outdated. The guest bathroom shower needed to be fixed, because it had water spraying every where. Both bathrooms, the shower doors don’t close properly and causes water spill out and wet entire the floor. 

Amenities: The pool area is nice but the pool bathroom was beyond gross! This is an absolute turn off and makes this hotel a 1 star in my books. There were cobwebs everywhere, it was old and outdated, looked run down and very unclean. Ive seen gas station restrooms cleaner and better kept than this! Even the hall way to the pool was out dated and looked like you were in the ghetto or a building in the slums. 

Staff: I can say as soon as I went downstairs and informed a staff member of the bathroom issue, they were right on it. 

Overall staff were nice, friendly, attentive and helpful. 

This is not anywhere near a 5 star hotel or what you would expect at all especially with it being a luxury hotel and/or seeing the entrance and lobby area. 

I haven’t seen the rest of the building yet, I will update this at the end of the week!","December 30, 2024",30,December,2024

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"This hotel could be so much better. The reception staff are very helpful and polite. But other staff especially at breakfast appeared quite miserable at times.
The rooms are getting outdated and rough around the edges.
The springs in one half of our mattress were completely gone. But it was changed on request.
The pool and gym are of a pretty good standard.
Breakfast was varied but the food was  generally pretty cold. Breakfast was also a very hectic time. One thing I did not appreciate was how the staff brought the waste trolley to the table to clear the plates, rather than take the plates away. It isn't very nice having other people's waste scrapped off plates into a bin while you are trying to eat. This was a regular occurrence. 
I would not recommend this hotel. I know there are other hotels in Bangkok which are better for a similar price, which are also in slightly better locations.
We tried it, but once is enough.","December 30, 2024",30,December,2024

I paid more money to get a room on higher floors to have a nice view, however, they got me floor 13-15 or so (I dont remember exactly), however, the view was terrible, I could only see roofs of other buildings, so wasted money. Breakfast was very good, really nice choice, staff friendly. We didnt swim but the pool looked nice. The furniture in our room was older, but it didnt matter to me. The rooftop bar has nice view but drinks are really expensive.  If you want to go to China town or in more central areas, it is like 7 km from hotel.","December 26, 2024",26,December,2024

Since it was already 1 AM and we were exhausted, we decided to just stay in the room.

I understand that the hotel is older, and that's okay, but the cleanliness was unacceptable. The sink and shower room weren’t properly cleaned, and there were stains on the toilet, which was really off-putting.","December 17, 2024",17,December,2024

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"First of all, the accommodation is very spacious and comfortable! We had a separate space for the kitchen, living room, and bedroom, with two bathrooms, making it easy to use without complications with the kids. The station was a bit far to walk, but we could easily call a taxi! There’s a convenience store 10 minutes away where we could buy whatever we needed, and at night, a small night market (focused on food) opened right in front of the hotel, making it convenient to have local food for dinner! It said that a 7-Eleven is expected to open in the building next to the hotel, which would be really great. There's a cafe at the gas station next door where we could buy coffee, drinks, breakfast sandwiches, snacks, etc., but it closed at night, so we only used it in the morning. All the hotel staff were friendly, and there were no issues communicating in English. They clean upon request, and they provide water daily, but it’s only 500 ml, so we bought extra from the convenience store when needed (additional water is 80 Baht per bottle). 
The pool is long and nice at 1.4 meters deep, making it good for swimming, but it might be a bit deep for young children who are not proficient swimmers (there’s no separate kids’ pool). There’s a gym right next to the pool, which is clean and nice. However, wearing sports shoes is mandatory for exercising; slippers and bare feet are not allowed, so please keep that in mind. Overall, it seems to be the best value for a family accommodation.","December 16, 2024",16,December,2024

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"First of all, I am a 20-year veteran of independent travel, and since this was a trip with my 5-month-old baby, I compared various aspects and made my accommodation decision.

Firstly, the location is not close to any tourist attractions on the map. However, this means that it is a midpoint that is not far from any attractions. In fact, there isn't much traffic, so it's easy to get around with Grab, and there is Tops Market in the basement of the Empire Tower, which is a 10-minute walk away, and the famous Healthland Spa is just 15 minutes away. 
The room condition is great with a residence-style layout and an open view, and the swimming pool was very nice too. However, since the depth is 1.4m, it's essential to have tubes or safety equipment when accompanied by infants. The cleanliness was generally good, and they provide razors upon request.
If you request in advance, they will set up a baby crib, and the water pressure is quite good.
The breakfast had fewer options, but it was delicious and the well-rounded menu changed slightly every day, so I enjoyed it thoroughly over the four days.
Oh, and the spa inside the hotel offers a discount for two people, making the price satisfying, and the massage was excellent.
Lastly, the friendly staff who always smiled and greeted us made our trip very pleasant.","December 11, 2024",11,December,2024

Our requests were promptly attended to (including having the air vent cleaned as soon as we arrived) and we had a very comfortable stay. Very clean linens were given, spotless living room and dining area, even glasswares and cutlery were provided. We were also treated with a selection of delicious, well planned entrées during breakfast. Though, we highly recommend that the noodle soup and congee is served hot. (I had to request to the server to heat up my noodle soup.)

The location is near Silom where most of our engagements were located. We highly recommend to always take a Grab though. Taking a bus or the MRT is not recommended if you will stay in this hotel. Taxis are available at the main entrance of the property (few minutes walk from the lobby) as it is hard to come by at the lobby.

Over-all, this property is highly recommended. Expect wear and tear in the rooms but they have managed to maintain the highest level of cleanliness and keep up with the demands of their guests the best they can. Check-in may somehow be an inconvenience since this hotel is very in-demand and always booked, you can expect a lot of people in the lobby either arriving or for departure, or sometimes there may be some delays during check-in. If you would like to stay here, better book in advance as their rooms sell out fast especially their one-bedroom suites and skyline suites. Guaranteed... you will have a wonderful stay at JC.

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"완벽한 숙박 경험!

최근에 JC Kevin Sathorn Bangkok Hotel에서 멋진 시간을 보냈습니다. 방콕의 중심부에 위치하여 주요 관광지와 쉽게 접근할 수 있다는 점이 아주 편리했습니다. 호텔 주변은 조용하고, 그럼에도 불구하고 활기찬 도심의 분위기를 느낄 수 있어 좋았습니다.

객실은 넓고 깨끗했으며, 침대는 매우 편안했습니다. 특히 큰 창문을 통해 보이는 도심의 뷰는 일품이었습니다. 매일 아침마다 방콕의 아름다운 전경을 감상하며 하루를 시작할 수 있어 좋았어요.

호텔 내 시설도 훌륭했습니다. 헬스장은 잘 관리되어 있어 운동을 즐기기에 부족함이 없었고, 수영장은 도시의 소음에서 벗어나 편안히 쉴 수 있는 완벽한 장소였습니다. 또한, 조식 뷔페는 다양한 메뉴가 제공되어 입맛에 맞는 음식을 쉽게 찾을 수 있었습니다. 특히 태국 전통 음식 코너가 인상적이었어요.

무엇보다 직원들의 친절함이 돋보였습니다. 체크인부터 체크아웃까지 세심하게 신경 써 주었고, 언제나 미소로 맞아주어 기분이 좋았습니다. 방콕을 다시 방문하게 된다면, 꼭 이곳에 다시 머물고 싶습니다.

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"We are so delighted in our stay in Jc Kevin, the staff are all friendly and accommodating, I like the smell of this hotel, the quality and comfort of bed really love the comfy pillow,  just next time replenish the complete toiletries specially towels. Location is ok its near to every places we wanted to go but just not to mention the traffic. 
However,  hoping that next time the resturant can make it more cooler and also add more varieties in the breakfast menu like hash-brown, bacon and pad thai and etc.

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"We were a big group of 20 heads, originally booked for 21 but my nephew did not make it. It was 5 families altogether. We enjoyed our stay in Bangkok though it was short. Staff were kind and helpful.  The hotel grounds are clean and very presentable. The receptionists are attentive and polite.  My family had a great time during our stay. Our rooms were being cleaned almost every day.  There was 1 day only that it wasn’t cleaned but that day we left the room a bit later that morning.  It was seems the staff has been in our room when we went for breakfast and had managed to re supply us with water bottles only. Not most hotels do that in my experience, so far our rooms had  daily supply of water as promised based on the benefits from the hotel. In our short stay, we did not manage to explore all the amenities of the hotel as we have to explore more of the local places in Bangkok instead. It was a huge hotel, we failed to use the swimming pool as we had kids, they could have enjoyed that.., I also had no time to check on the other bars particularly the top floor’s . Anyway, to sum it up.. we failed to see most of the hotel’s amenities but then my family had a great time so far during our stay at JC Kevin.  It was fun for us to see Bangkok at our short stay at the hotel. Perhaps if I will go back again to Bangkok, I would pick this hotel again for my family and will make sure we have enough time to spend a day to enjoy the hotel’s amenities. So yes, I would recommend this hotel for others to enjoy their stay in Bangkok.","November 28, 2024",28,November,2024

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"We booked two rooms (one for our 2 boys and another for us) and unfortunately they were on different floors (21 & 34). Nothing could be changed on our first night but thankfully they did manage to get us two rooms on the same floor which made the stay much better. 
Breakfast was incredibly busy and not really enough staff. The breakfast was ok, but certainly not comparable to other 5 star hotels in Bangkok. The coffee in particular was very disappointing!!
The pool is nice but again perhaps a lack of staff as not always new / clean towels as an option.
The rooms are huge and that is brilliant, but many of the smaller details are 4 star - quality of the towels; the tiles; the general state of all furniture is all a bit dated.
Location is really good.
Not sure what is happening with the gym. Very old / tired weights machines with more modern treadmills, although the screens didn’t work. No gym manager around!
Hotel Staff are really friendly.
In many ways this is a great hotel; a little aged and understaffed but a very good location and if a little cherish and love is given to each floor then could be wonderful again!
So compared to other BKK 5* hotels, this is not really up there m, however it does have many god features and so it is between a 4 and 4.5* in our opinion.","November 26, 2024",26,November,2024

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"It’s an old 5 star hotel. The rooms are big but the beds were soft, carpets old, sofa has holes and stains and the tiles are cracked in the bathroom.

The breakfast was ok, although very crowded as the serving area was small for such a large hotel. The coffe was terrible.

The biggest disappointment was the sky bar was closed for renovation, this was one of the reasons I booked this hotel. 

There are some nice restaurants and food stalls near the hotel. The road outside is always clogged with traffic, so going anywhere by taxi is a nightmare. It’s about 15 minutes walk to the BTS which doesn’t seem far, until you factor is the heat. Therefore if I come to Bangkok again I’d book a hotel right next to public transport.

Pool was nice and the gym looked good too, but overall it’s a disappointing hotel and it’s not 5 stars anymore.","November 25, 2024",25,November,2024

Towels are rough and don't look clean. Tv doesn't work at all. It's like a 24inch tv in our premium suite. Carpet is super dirty. Don't let the 5 star category fool you. If it charge you a 5 star rate, don't bother living here just because they have a 5 star modern reception. It's about 10-15min walk to chong nonsi station.

Bangkok,JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL,5 stars out of 5,"I arrived late as my flights were delayed. I checked into the two bedrooms suites. Around 2 am on Friday morning as I booked the room from Thursday. There was water leaked, dripping into the small bedroom. The rooms were not cleaned. After I saw the condition I called front desk. He sent maintenance guys right away which was impressive at 2.30 am. The staffs were honest and told me that the room was not in a living condition. 
I called the front desk trying to figured out the options. There was no other room except one bedroom suites on different floors so I cannot take two rooms. I finally agreed to move into a one bedroom suites with extra bed so I have time to contact Agoda. I didn’t have Thai phone. The hotel room didn’t have options for me to call external phone number from my room. The staff told me he was willing to refund the fees with one night charge but I need to contact Agoda. 
This whole thing was a joke. After about 8 hours I got a real response from Agoda saying they needed time to investigate. Around 8 or 9 pm I called front desk and they said they could get me another two bedrooms suites but I had to wait until 2 pm. Let’s pause and think for a minute of how much time I lost on my vacation and how much rest if I had any. 
I came with two young children. I cannot do anymore until I knew for sure we had a livable room or I would have to move to a different hotel. I finally moved into another two bedrooms suites I paid for around 3.30 pm on Friday. 
I was checking my email constantly but I didn’t see any response from Agoda. I handled every by myself. Sometimes that day or the next the hotel sent apology letter with fruit plate. I checked out on Sunday. On Sunday morning I called and asked if I can do late check out the hotel said I can stay until 1 pm or they will charge me 5,000 baht.  I told them I didn’t think I would be back but I could be back around 2 pm. Anyway, there was no accommodation so I checked out at 20 am and left all of my belongings with the bellman until 2.30 pm. 
After I left I saw an email from Agoda that the only thing they can offer was late check out.
From then til now, I don’t think I was compensated for the time I lost, for the downgraded room I received and the overall experience. 
Quick summary: 
1. When you see 5 stars on Agoda website for this hotel, that’s not true. Don’t make your decision based on this like I did. 
2. It is not clean, bring sanitizer wipes.
3. Make sure it’s the room you want or have ways to contact Agoda because you will not get a quick response by chat. Maybe it will be faster if you have roaming or Thai phone. 
4. If you are allergic to dust, take your meds or go somewhere else.","November 15, 2024",15,November,2024

Bangkok,Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,5 stars out of 5,"Unfortunately, my experience was far below expectations due to several issues, which were not resolved in a timely manner.

I was initially assigned a room that had an unpleasant odor, likely due to improper cleaning and airing out from previous guests, blocked bath and vanity tub. I was moved to two additional rooms, but each one also had an odor. The staff, although helpful, seemed uncertain about how to resolve the issue effectively. It took hours for a porter to arrive to assist with the room change, and on the third occasion, I was given the keys to the new room by a receptionist and ended up moving my luggage myself. I do not understand why the keys were not provided to me initially, which would have saved time and hassle.

The third room I was moved to had a similar issue, and the manager on duty came to clean and deodorize the room late in the evening. I was informed that the room was located opposite a storage area for garbage, which had not been properly cleaned by the staff.

Additionally, my requests made through Agoda and directly with the hotel to accommodate my room preferences were never honored, even after I paid for upgrades.

Given the lack of management oversight and the inconvenience caused, I feel that my experience was not representative of the standard I expected. I do not plan to stay at this hotel again, and I hope my feedback will be taken into consideration to improve future guest experiences.","April 08, 2025",8,April,2025

Outstanding Dining Experience

One of the highlights of our stay was the on-site Benihana, where we enjoyed a fantastic teppanyaki dining experience. But what truly blew us away was the breakfast buffet—it was out of this world! The variety was impressive, and the ingredients tasted SO FRESH. Every morning felt like a gourmet feast, setting the perfect tone for the day.

Exceptional Service

From check-in to check-out, the staff was incredibly pleasant and accommodating. Throughout our 7-day stay, we were consistently greeted with warmth and professionalism, making us feel truly welcome.

Great Location & Nearby Conveniences

The hotel is in a great location, with easy access to Bangkok’s famous malls via Grab. Plus, there’s a 7-Eleven convenience store nearby, perfect for quick snacks and essentials. If you’re craving authentic Thai cuisine, there’s a great Thai restaurant just a few steps away, along with a Thai massage place where you can unwind after a long day.

Bangkok,Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,5 stars out of 5,"1. Pricing: They charge you a bomb. Paid 60k for 5N/6D. Breakfast not included in the huge price.

2. Room Condition: Booked a room for 3 ppl, requested higher floor, and non smoking room. Got placed on 11th floor, king bed, SMOKING ROOM which was stinking like shit. Requested the staff to shift my room because it was not my per my request. They agreed. We waited for 1 hour and called them 5 times after which they came to shift us. The new room was twin bedded and they put an extra bed. We asked to be shifted to a superior family room because that’s what I had paid for. They said I had to follow up with them at the reception every morning to check availability. What a joke. Finally on my 3rd day of stay they gave me a room on the 19th floor with extra bed.

3. Service: TERRIBLE. We literally had to call the staff minimum 5 times to get a job done. We have waited for more than an hour to get water. We requested sugar and ketchup and were given a bill of 250bhat. Hahahaha. 

4. Food: PATHETIC. Don’t eat at the restaurant ever. They don’t know how to cook.

5. Overall: I would never ever recommend you staying at this hotel at such an expensive pricing ever. You will get 5star stays at such a lesser price and top notch service than this.","March 14, 2025",14,March,2025

The location is almost decent, with a few shops and eateries nearby, but it's situated on a busy road, making street noise a constant presence.
While the price may seem competitive, the pictures on their ad are misleading and we think it was not worth the money.

The breakfast spread was impressive in terms of variety, though the taste could be improved—it was decent but not particularly delicious.

The room was clean and well-maintained, but the bed was quite hard, making it a bit uncomfortable for a restful night’s sleep.

The location is convenient for moving around Bangkok, but it’s worth noting that there aren’t any shops or restaurants nearby, which might be inconvenient for some travelers.

When you check-in, they will ask you to do deposit of 1000Bhat.
1st when i was at the reception for check-in, I was asked to wait and I was standing infront of the receptionist. She started addressing another customer. I had waited for sometime and asked her to address me 1st then she told to another receptionist to address me and that person is the manager. He showed me hand to just come. When I approached, he again asked my name asked me to wait. I had asked why I should wait since I waiting in the queue for such a long time. He didn't even answered my question and started collecting my passport which was collected a long time before. Nobody is ready to hear what you say. Nobody is ready to ask who you are and what's your name. Just calling you, Mr. Come here , mr. Go there. , mr. Take this.... 

Even when I had addressed all these they were not ready to hear.

When we are checking out the hotel. They had asked to sign a registration form, i had asked why should I sign if I am checking out the hotel. The executive was telling, if i need the deposit money, I need to sign. 

I had again asked, I don't want to sign the registration form, since the form saying you are registering with your consent. She told, you sign and get the money.

A huge negative was the proliferation of charter buses that never seemed to end!  Literally hundreds of guests would arrive throughout the day making it near impossible to get through the lobby at times or use the elevator; further, despite offering a fabulous breakfast the hordes made it literally impossible to partake in the feast.

Bangkok,Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,5 stars out of 5,"I had really bad experience at Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium.
I booked 2 rooms online from Agoda and requested airport transfer. 1 day before check in I called directly to hotel and after booking ID checking the person on call confirmed airport transfer to hotel.
We I landed at Bangkok airport I waited there for pick up but no body showed up. I called to hotel and they said we don't provide airport transfer and they told Agoda about this, whereas they confirmed airport transfer 1 day before on call. Then I took cab from airport to hotel.
When I reached hotel and went for check in. They said they don't have 2 skyline rooms available and they gave 1 on skyline and 1 on lower floor.
When I booked and paid for 2 skyline rooms then why rooms are not available? If rooms are not available then why they advertise online and show available online.
I called Agoda and discussed this with them. They called hotel reservation officer but they didn't resolve my problem and they didn't give skyline rooms (rooms were available but hotel staff were not giving us skyline rooms).
I requested Agoda for refund and they talked to hotel and hotel said they will talk to us about this and someone from reservation department will meet me personally at hotel reception.
After call hotel staff said they won't refund money and they said they don't follow Agoda policy and nobody will meet me from reservation dept.
I took more than 3 hours to get rooms. My friend was badly sick and I told them he is sick but still they didn't cooperated with us. We left with no option we had waited.
After checking in I got to know there are many rooms available on skyline floor but they didn't give us.
2 days before check out I asked for hotel to airport transfer but they said we don't follow Agoda policy and If we need airport transfer we have to pay extra money.

Bangkok,Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is in a prime location with restaurants and a 7-Eleven nearby. There is parking and charging stations for electric cars. We have stayed here before, but this time there were many issues. The room was not ready for check-in even though it was already the time. We waited for the room for hours, and it wasn't just us. The staff seemed to be few and insufficient to provide service. Furthermore, when they were unable to find a room, they disappeared, which made international customers frustrated. We don't know what happened to the system here, but we hope they seriously improve it. Aside from the delayed check-in, everything else was fine. The gym was very good with a variety of equipment; it's a pity we only used it for one day. And at check-out, we lost the parking voucher, but the staff was very helpful. Although we had to wait a little longer, we appreciate their assistance in coordinating with the security team. The other staff members were polite and provided good service as usual.

Bangkok,Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,5 stars out of 5,"Very good hotel, I booked the top room which had an amazing view of the Bangkok skyline. Bed was huge and confortable, with a spacious living area including sofa and even desk (should you be travelling for work, quite useful).
Facilities were excellent, on site massages (which I didn’t use) sauna and steam room, pool with a bar. Gym open 24 hours (again, didn’t use that one but at a glance looked well maintained and plenty of equipment).
I ordered room service, to be honest you can easily get better food at much better value elsewhere in Bangkok, but nonetheless it was good food, and the ice cream was fantastic. Do not order beer/alcohol, it is three times the price of the 7/11 which is a mere 2m walk from the hotel, beer prices didn’t appear on the menu either which was quite a surprise when the bill arrived. There was also a hidden service charge for room service. So that’s why for “facilities” I’ve marked it down slightly, otherwise it’s five stars.
Location wise there is a metro about 12 m away, I stayed here because it was slightly closer to the airport, and the Metro has a line straight to the airport. I would say that it is well situated otherwise, being not too far away from some key tourist areas of Bangkok.
I got this hotel for an absolute steal o. Agoda, with reduced pricing as it was a last minute booking, so keep that in mind if you are booking without apparent discounts, I believe the full price is closer to £130 per night and at that amount you may find cheaper alternatives elsewhere with near as good facilities.","December 29, 2024",29,December,2024

Nice breakfast offerings and the overall cleanliness of the property.

However, the service can be inconsistent. While the food experience was good. I found the staff being less attentive or friendly, Also, I noted that the hotel porters are slow, unhelpful and unresponsive.

Bangkok,Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,5 stars out of 5,"I recently stayed at the Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium and had a decent experience overall. The staff were exceptionally helpful and attentive, which really enhanced my stay. The cleanliness of the hotel was superb, making me feel comfortable and at home. 

However, the location is a bit of a drawback. It’s quite far from malls and markets, and walking to nearby attractions is not really an option. On the positive side, the Jodd Fairs night market is nearby, and a Grab taxi ride there costs around 90-120 baht, which is convenient. 

One area that could use improvement is the breakfast selection. There weren’t many choices available, and I was disappointed that traditional Thai food wasn’t showcased. It felt like I wasn’t really experiencing breakfast in Bangkok, unlike other restaurants I've dined at in different countries. 

Also, a note for fellow All Accor members: remember that you can’t tag your booking to your membership, which was a bit frustrating. 

Overall, the hotel offers great service and cleanliness, but the location and breakfast options could be better.","December 22, 2024",22,December,2024

The room was clean, large, the bed was comfortable.   The view out the window was nice.   The staff was nice. 


The bathroom sink facets was loose, air condition is cold, but I can’t control it.  I set 26-31 C degrees and it’s 22C in the room.  

I arrived at the hotel at 1am, there was a fussy guest and bunch of airline crews checking in and it took me over 20 mins to check in.    

In the morning the lobby was filled with people.  Some with quite the BO. 

They have a shuttle service, but the location is far from anything interesting.   At least 10 mins walk to the nearest MRT.

Bangkok,Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,5 stars out of 5,"We stayed here for 3 nights. It's a big hotel, and it's pretty well maintained for an old property. This hotel looks busy all the time with mostly Indian guests, and for those who enjoy Indian food, they offer excellent breakfast selections. Service, in general, is really average compared to all other Accor properties we have stayed at so far. The location is far from MRT, and it's awful to walk to the train station during the day given the intense heat from the hot sun. Although they do offer shuttle service to the station, we never seem to be able to fit into their hourly schedule.","December 01, 2024",1,December,2024

They also provide notices for service interruptions and provide complimentary delights/snacks. The only issue I've got was the location since it was quite far from the nearest train station. Although the bus station was just in front of the hotel, I found it quite difficult to ride one as I wasn't familiar with the bus routes and the information given on the respective websites of the bus company/ies were quite inaccurate (not that I'm blaming the hotel but it would have been better if the train station was near as it was easier to follow directions in the train routes).

Bangkok,Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,5 stars out of 5,"We had 4 days in Bangkok, so time was of the essence.

The staff gave us wrong information on multiple accounts, or just did not know anything about what we where asking. For example, Longtail boat tour…. “No sorry they stopped in Covid” So we booked online, after taking almost an hour trying to get information from the Travel desk, check in desk and the concierge desk.
And when asking about Sea life they gave us the wrong opening hours, and more little things like that, but it adds up and trust to the staff fades quickly.

Service at the front desk was so slow and lines forming at all hours. I needed to exchange some Euros to Baht, and it took 28 minutes after I got to the desk. On the day of departure I went to the front desk and asked if they could prepare our paperwork while I went upstairs to get the kids (to speed things up and safe my kids from waiting in the lobby wile I checked out) “Yes sure no problem” was the response and I was very happy, got the kids, came back 30 min later and NOTHING had happened. 

And then we are at breakfast, no cheese anywhere in sight. So, I asked for some and that was NO problem (very nice) but it arrived after we had finished our breakfast! Six juices available (very cool) but all from concentrate! And the Instant coffee from the room was much better than the coffee from the buffet. On all 3 days that we had breakfast we needed to ask for extra cooking time on the bacon and they took it back to the kitchen and that took some time let me tell you. 
So, my point is that they did indeed comply to all of requests, but It took so long that we felt that we did a lot of wasting time waiting around.

The pool area was very nice and the service the best in all the hotel, BUT why is the pool so cold??? 21 degrees Celsius in not a nice relaxing experience. My fellow travelers, relaxing by the pool, all agreed that they could not use the pool, even we all wanted to cool down this was way too cold.","October 26, 2024",26,October,2024

You can see the age and dirtyness with age but it has been renovated over the last year and is much better. 

One recommendation I would like to make to the management. The new sauna is awesome and the steam room has very good steam and heat. However as someone who enjoys very much hot and cold water therapy, there isn't any COLD water like a plunge or cold bucket you can stand under and pull after the hot treatment. 

This is required to make the treatment most effective cold water shock and hear shock. 

Please get a cold water something. 

I will be back! Thank you

Bangkok,Amari Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"We arrived on the evening of the recent earthquake event in March. As expected there were long queues of guests waiting to check in and all the counters were opened. We waited about 45min before we got check in. During the wait we saw the counter staff assisting guests of all nationalities; some like us were waiting to check in while some who checked out in panic earlier wanted to recheck in and have their rooms back, while some came down to request for lower floors. Tempers were high as the wait were long and some demanded since they had checked in earlier they just wanted the same rooms back, which was impossible as the rooms were cleared and reassigned to others. We admired that the staff maintained their cool, explained politely and treated each guest fairly I.e: they asked those attempted to cut queue to wait. We could see they were very tired already but still carried on patiently.

Our assigned room was on the 18th floor and along the way up we scanned the walls and pillars for any sign of cracks due to the earthquake. Was relief to say we didn’t see any except for some dust or loose paint flakes. In the room, there was a long crack on the partition wall separating the bedroom and bathroom. We were not sure if it was already there to begin with but the rest of the room was clean and neat. 

Delighted to see that they even have pillow menu - which the staff reacted and delivered our request very quickly.

Next morning, we noticed some abnormalities with one of the lift and informed the staff. When we returned mid day, they had shut down 3 out of their 6 lifts for intensive maintenance. The q and wait for the lifts were long and one of the lady staff was stationed there to direct guest and those attempting to cut queue. We went and returned late at night and she was still there. We saluted her as she had worked late the night before and was still here to carry out her work all day.

All in all, the staff left us with very warm feeling and we felt safe under their care.

Location to the near by Big C, Central World, Erawan Shrine were all within 15min walks. Opp the hotel is platinum mall and December. Down the same street as the hotel was the night market and wholesale shopping and massage parlours.

We will definitely return to stay here in our next visit.","May 16, 2025",16,May,2025

The staff were all super friendly and helpful, from the front desk to housekeeping. Our room had a classic feel, with a comfy sofa, work desk, and a TV that supports casting from your phone.

The only downsides: there’s no direct bridge to Platinum Mall, so we had to walk a bit and cross the street, which wasn’t ideal since my partner is pregnant. Also, the nearby 7-Elevens are quite small and not very well stocked, especially at night. One small note—there was a little insect in the bathroom, so hopefully they can improve cleanliness there.

Bangkok,Amari Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"I liked the location..but was warned by our driver that there will be roadwork along the road infront of the hotel next year and to expect more traffic. To be confirmed on your own. *disclamer*

The breakfast spread offers many south asian and middle eastern dishes. Not much of the rest of asian food but i am happy so long there are plenty of fresh bakes,  fruits and salad.

What is truly impressive is their gym and sport amenities..you can book a pilates instructor or use the fully equipped pilates studio on your own.....play squash ..swim( but is very cold this time of the year). We had a round of Table tennis by the pool and used the huge gym with every.kind of machines you need from top to toe. 

After workout you can relax  by the pool and hit the paragon mall which is 10mins walk if you take the short cut through chaterium and kempinski hotel.

Will stay here again depends on the situation of the roadwork.","February 25, 2025",25,February,2025

Bangkok,Amari Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"I booked Amari Bangkok without doing much research as it was a very last minute trip to Bangkok.

I felt so glad I did as it was the best choice I made coming back to Bangkok after more than 10 years. 

Checking in was easy breezy and we were given a complimentary early check - in as we got ourselves a morning flight to Bangkok. 

The walk along the corridor to our room was pleasantly scented which lifted up our mood. 

I booked a Premier Twin Room which comes with 2 double beds, perfect size for our family of 2 adults and 2 young children. 

The room is very clean and well maintained. 

I did not book the room stay with breakfast but on one of the mornings, we decided to try out the breakfast buffet after reading good reviews about it. The breakfast buffet has a huge spread of food and they even cater halal food in their spread. 

Their fitness facilities like the swimming pool and the gym are very well maintained. The gym has a lot of equipment unlike most hotel gyms. 

The location is so convenient as it is walking distance to many shopping areas. 

Platinum Mall is just across the street and when we walked a bit further behind Platinum Mall, there is a bridge leading to Central World. We even walked a bit further to the right out of Central World to go to Siam Paragon - Siam Centre - Siam Discovery - Siam Square. 

In the evening, we only needed to walk to Pratunam Night Market. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel.","February 12, 2025",12,February,2025

Bangkok,Amari Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Amari Bangkok and my experience was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I arrived, the staff went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and memorable.

Amy at the check-in counter was warm and welcoming, making the check-in process seamless. She was attentive and provided helpful information about the hotel amenities and surrounding area.

The porter was equally impressive, handling my luggage with care and efficiency while offering a friendly demeanor that immediately made me feel at ease.

The staff at the pool counter were also fantastic, ensuring everything I needed was readily available. Their professionalism and cheerful attitude added to the relaxing atmosphere.

A special mention goes to Mr. Khawan (I hope I’ve spelled his name correctly), the customer service manager. His dedication to guest satisfaction was evident throughout my stay. He went out of his way to check in on out experience and ensured that every detail was attended to with precision.

Thank you to the entire team for such outstanding service. I look forward to returning and will highly recommend Amari Bangkok to others!

Bangkok,Amari Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"It was our first time to stay in Amari Bangkok and we were impressed!
First, we arrived early in the hotel before check in time and the lady at the front desk looked for a vacant room similar to our booking so we can check in early. And she did find one! I forgot her name but thank you so much because coming from a very early flight this is very helpful and much appreciated!
Second, the room is very spacious and clean and has a modern ambiance which we love!
Third, the staff are all very friendly, helpful and accomodating! When we call to ask for water or towels, they come up right away to give our requests! And we were specifically impressed when we asked if they have a packing tape and a marker so, we could seal the box of the golf clubs my husband bought. They said they'll check if they have one. And voila,  after a few minutes someone is knocking at our hotel room door and brought the packing tape and marker! This is what you call VERY GOOD SERVICE!
Fourth, we have only tried their Italian restaurant Prego and everything we ordered was delicious!
Fifth, the location is very good! It is across Platinum Fashion Mall, walking distance to Central World, Siam Paragon and Big C! And there are a lot of street food around the area and 7-Eleven! There are also a lot of money changers in the area which make it very convenient!
Overall, I highly recommend Amari Bangkok and will prefer to stay here again on our next visit in Bangkok!","February 09, 2025",9,February,2025

We opt for breakfast buffet for one of the mornings (add on cost) but I feel it’s so worth it (as compared to the $8-$10 street food outside P mall). The only thing that annoyed me was the soundproofing/door slamming in the morning. Hope the door mechanics will be looked into during the renovation.","February 05, 2025",5,February,2025

When we went to have our breakfast, I asked a staff member named Khamrara for a baby chair. She gave me a look and seemed to roll her eyes, with a clear expression of impatience.

The thin male staff member who assisted us during check-in had a bit of a stiff demeanor; when I asked if we could change rooms due to a blocked view, he gave vague answers and didn’t seem very nice in his response. I've stayed at much more expensive accommodations, but they had a bleach smell in the pool, while here there was no smell and the pool quality was good.

Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"First of all, it's good for taking pictures. They said the breakfast was delicious, but it was just so-so for me. Maybe because there were so many Koreans, there wasn't any Thai-style exotic food. The room was clean, but with three people, it was uncomfortable to move around with an extra bed, and above all, the room was small, so I could hear my companions using the bathroom and even see their silhouettes, and the shower kept falling off. Moreover, when lying on the bed, the air conditioning breeze hit my face directly. In the end, I had to sleep in reverse, or else I'd get a sore throat right away. Despite this, what’s great about this hotel is that there are amazing restaurants just a 10-minute walk away from the photos. The staff are generally friendly, but they have more of a resort style than hotel staff. Since the reviews from Koreans are good, and there aren’t many resort-style places in downtown Bangkok, it’s worth checking out once. Choose this place if you want a comfortable and safe meal. But if you want to feel more of Bangkok, then no.","November 11, 2024",11,November,2024
Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"It was my first time traveling to Southeast Asia, and I made a reservation after looking for accommodations here and there. I was worried about reviews mentioning that it's a bit of a walk to the convenience store, but I ended up walking less than I expected, and it was nice to walk as a stroll. In fact, it's a walkable distance to Lumphini Station, so I walked around the entire time I stayed. The staff were very friendly and the pool is really beautiful.","November 04, 2024",4,November,2024

I usually don't have breakfast, but I enjoyed it so much throughout the trip, haha. The inside of the accommodation might feel slightly worn in parts like the bathroom, but I got the impression they are trying to maintain it well. However, the water in Thailand isn’t very clean, so a shower filter is essential, and all the staff members are very friendly, which is great. The best part was the late checkout. It's the first time I've seen an accommodation where you can check out at any time you want. I was really happy not to have to awkwardly book a value accommodation on the last day!","November 03, 2024",3,November,2024

Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"This is my second stay and I still received good service, but it wasn't as good as the first time two years ago. I have a small complaint... Since I came alone, I had to park the car first and then walk in carrying my luggage. It might have been during the Songkran holiday, which is why there were no bellboys to help with the luggage on both arrival and departure days. However, overall, I was very impressed with the staff at the restaurant by the pool. They provided great service and were very lovely.","September 14, 2024",14,September,2024
Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"The Similar Ton Bangkok has a 24-hour checkout system, so I booked it for the last day of my trip.

As soon as I entered the hotel, my first impression was very good thanks to the beautiful view, clean building, peaceful birdsong, and the bright smiles of the staff.

They kindly upgraded me to a garden view room for free, making my last day in Thailand even more wonderful.

Since my room was on the first floor, if I opened the large glass window, it led to the grass (garden), and just a few steps further was the swimming pool.

I usually don’t take advantage of hotel breakfasts, but since it was included, I decided to try it. The menu offered a buffet and the option to order main dishes, and the food was neatly and cleanly prepared. It tasted great, and it seemed the hotel chef was quite famous.

You could choose to dine indoors or outdoors, and I opted for outdoors to enjoy the beautiful view while eating. Enjoying breakfast while looking at the pool and the garden made me feel like the protagonist in a movie.

As I was finishing my meal, a staff member brought me a note asking how my first trip alone was going and wishing me a good journey, written in Korean with great care. Who wouldn't be touched by such service?

Among the seven hotels, this was the only one that had its own hotel app, which I could use to access various information and request services. There was also a free mini shuttle that took guests to the subway station at specific times.

I almost forgot to mention that upon check-in, they provided a cool towel and a delicious welcome drink, and the juice was truly tasty. The hotel deposit could be paid in cash or by credit card. Since it was the last day of my trip, I paid a deposit of 1,000 baht by credit card. It is worth noting that it takes about two weeks to refund the deposit afterward.

In conclusion, I greatly praise my choice to book this hotel. Anyone traveling to Thailand should certainly consider staying at this hotel at least once.","August 25, 2024",25,August,2024
Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"Situated down a maze of side streets, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the U Sathorn in Bangkok. The resorts was amazingly tranquil in contrast to the hustle & bustle of the surrounding city - it provided a great central location from which to explore the city, and a welcome retreat at the end of the day.

Our room had a balcony out onto the central pool and was modern, clean and beautifully appointed. The staff were incredibly attentive and efficient, and did a marvellous job ensuring we enjoyed every minute of our stay.

The highlight of the visit however was dinner at the superb J’aime restaurant - it thoroughly deserves it’s michelin ranking, and was far superior to many others we have dined at - worth the trip for this alone! Each course was beautifully constructed, visually stunning and a joy to eat - we’ll be back next time we’re in Bangkok!","August 27, 2024",27,August,2024

Although it's near the Lumphini subway station, it is located deep in an alley and the road is inconvenient for walking, so it's difficult to access on foot. The hotel offers a tuk-tuk service every two hours to take guests to the main road, but there is no return tuk-tuk service. You can make reservations for the Diora Spa, which is popular among Koreans, at the hotel front, and they conveniently take you there by tuk-tuk according to your reservation. It was a wonderful time that satisfied both my 20-year-old daughter and my 50-year-old mother.

The hygiene of the accommodation was very clean, and the cleaning was done thoroughly. Above all, the advantage of this accommodation is that there is a large swimming pool. Thanks to that, I cancelled one or two of my plans and enjoyed swimming during the day and night. It felt like a different kind of vacation compared to staying in a hotel in the city. Due to the nature of Thailand, the tap water is not very clean, but I prepared a shower filter in advance and replaced it for use. Seeing the filter turn yellow made me want to recommend that other future guests also prepare a filter in advance. Compared to other places I stayed afterward, the water was relatively clean, but I still recommend using a filter.

It takes a bit of time for the car to arrive, so I recommend calling in advance and waiting from your hotel room. The amenities are not luxurious. You shouldn't expect a sleek, recently built hotel.

The person that helped get our bags out of the taxi also brought our bags to our room. Our room was super nice and over looking the pool. Our room was spacious. When we walked into the room to see my name on the tv welcoming us. The tv was also an interactive guide to the hotel. It gave information on all of the options at the hotel. The shower had both a regular wand shower along with a rain shower head that I loved. The pool was amazing. It was a 25 meter pool so it was great to swim laps in the morning. The gym had all the essentials so you could get your workout in on vacation. Breakfast was included every morning and included the basic items like pastries, toast, jellies, ect., but also had thai items and a noodle station. They had a tuk tuk (shuttle) that would take you to the metro station and certain times which was great. My wife and I also asked the desks for a place to get a Thai massage and they setup an appointment for us and even took us there before the appointment. I had asked the front desk about how to mail out some post cards from my trip and they told me to bring them to the desk and they would do it for me. What hotel does that?!? During one of our days there the GM Jason came up to us to welcome us and ask if there was anything that we needed to contact him directly and he would have it taken care of right away.

Though this hotel is located in the center of the city, they managed to create an atmosphere that feels like you’re escaping a busy world to a peaceful, quiet and relaxing resort. Their rooms were clean and comfortable. Their staff have a pretty high standard of service as they are friendly, polite and helpful. Overall I enjoyed my stay.","May 12, 2023",12,May,2023

Our butler helped us to move our luggages also. Plus almost every workers there speaks brilliant English, sorry for keep comparing but better than other five star hotels in Bangkok. Most important thing is that they serve the best breakfast. A la carte and the semi-buffet was just phenomenal. Even though the city Bangkok is crowded, while you head to U sathorn, you will definitely be relieved and even feeling safe. Affordable price and brilliant exterior and interior. Gym is quite small but packed with <<Technogym>> like hello is this real? Room was huge and clean. One of the best hotel I've ever experienced in my life including six stars. I will definitely visit there again no matter of the occasion. Thanks for having us U Sathorn Bangkok.","April 29, 2023",29,April,2023

Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"Had a great time at U Sathorn Bangkok.  We got the deal on Agoda and it ended up being about $100 per night. You can find much cheaper in Bangkok, but if you are looking for an experience with attentive staff and an EXCELLENT breakfast buffet this is the place to go.  It is hidden a community right off of Sathorn.  

My only gripe was that the exercise room was lacking equipment and the only bench was broken at the time.  

The restaurant is a Michelin Star restaurant and is priced like one, but we had the breakfast buffet with our room and it was excellent.","April 23, 2023",23,April,2023

The location may not suit all but there's a 7-11 at the  end of the quiet side  road which also makes this tropical oasis very peaceful.

On the second night, I moved to a suite, which was very big, with a cool air conditioner. The minibar was well-stocked. I loved the soap; it smelled nice on my skin. The breakfast options may not have been many, but they were delicious and filling. You could order it to eat in your room as well. The atmosphere in the hotel was very good, making it easy to relax and forget about the hustle and bustle of the city. The staff here were all cheerful and greeted us every time we met them, so much so that we felt a bit shy. I really liked it! I was impressed with everything, with no complaints at all.

Everything from the excellent service, the comfortable rooms, the friendly and polite staff, to the lush and refreshing environment is wonderful. Since the moment we arrived, there has been nothing that made us feel bad; only feelings of being impressed, to the point where we didn't want to go home. The 24-hour check-in is genuine here; there are no hidden catches. We stayed for two nights and changed room types, yet we received welcome fruits both nights, unlike some places that don’t provide anything even for one night. We also stayed during our birthday, and the hotel arranged a cake and wine for us. Thank you very much for being attentive to your customers. Our first stay has left a great impression, and we are extremely satisfied. We will definitely come back again.","April 09, 2023",9,April,2023
Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"Perfect staff, great rooms, great facilities, excellent food…Probably the best hotel n Bangkok.

The only negative point is the lack of privacy around the pool and restaurant.
Guests should behave and avoid making their lengthy photo shoots around the pool when other people are relaxing – I now feel like I am on every Facebook/Instagram/Tik-Tok/”Name it” in Thailand.","April 11, 2023",11,April,2023
Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"I stayed for about six nights in April 2022 and wanted to stay a bit away from the hecticness of any main roads. U Sathorn is nestled into a neighborhood and it was easy to call a motorcycle taxi or a Grab taxi to get out, or to walk to Sathorn or Rama IV and the public transportation available there.

The biggest draw for me is the pool that is long enough to do laps - 25 meters I think, and not too crowded. The staff were lovely and very helpful. I had some remote work to do and the room is nicely set up for that.

It's a bit pricey but whenever it dips into the lower range on Agoda, it's my first choice of a place to stay in Bangkok","March 24, 2023",24,March,2023

- the receptionist staff (only one of them, a guy) is really weird. I have the feeling that he's not well-trained. Especially when he took me a room introduction and checking in. Because the elevator is quite small (4 ppl max), when we enter instead of standing towards to door, he instead prefer to stand facing me on the way up to the 3rd floor.

However, I am quite disappointed with the staff service there. Some staff are really good and warm but some are poor in service. When I checked in the hotel, the staff insisted to ask me to show the credit card I used to book the hotel (whereas it did not mention in the email/TC and the hotel fee was already deducted from the credit card 1 month before i stay in the hotel). She told me that it is because I booked it through booking.com (but i booked from agoda...) There is miscommunication between the hotel and agoda ...however it made the customer feel annoyed and nonsense as no one will bring all the credit cards while travelling.

I am disappointed because (1)  no view outside the window. Just two chairs facing fence (2) the tile floor is broken in several places and the furniture somehow aren't not in good maintenance state.  (3) 24 HR check-in check-out might be good, but you can hear the noise from the hallway all the time (4) the shuttle tuk tuk only operated 1 time every hour. despite you are checking out and with big luggage, you still cannot use it. 
I have good experience with the other hotel in the group which is also 24 hour checkin checkout. But not this time.","August 04, 2022",4,August,2022

Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"Moder/high tech room
Very clean room and very good room layout
Great breakfast. Wish bread would be freshly baked and juices not from concentrate/artificial then  I would consider it perfect.
Staff very attentive, cordial, cortious.
Called few times for additional towels and soap - response time was 1-2 minutes. Very impressive!
Calling for taki from the hotel is 5-10 minutes delay. No big deal. Arrival back to the hotel causes some drivers to loose their way though signs are clear. I just learn the 3 turns from the main road to the hotel, how to say left and right in Thai (Qua, sa-yee) and prenlem resolved.
Hotel offers free yoga class (my wife tried it) and Thai language once a week.
Since I'm a foodie, here are the breakfast details:
Very clean, nice selection, very nice decor. This is a one star Michelin restaurant. Probably lunch and diner is more impressive but the breakfast was not as zesty as expected. Cheese selection is only 2 types of simple cheeses. Lox was scant and not of the best quality but it was just ok.
Nice selection of dried fruits. Pastries below average. Not crispy Danish / tart / Turnovers. Warm dishes are ok quality but not Tasty so I sleeper it and stocked to salad and lox.
You may order omelette ala carte but don't expect to consistency. I like my omelette spice with chopped chilly - once I got it hell hot next day I couldn't feel the chili.
Coffee / cappuccino / latte was very good so I had 2-3 cups every time.
Bread looks like ordered from a near by bakery, probably a day before but don't forget this is less than 100 room hotel and there is limited labor resource they can provide while price room for $100/night range. (For better nreakfast go to the mandarin oriental and pay $300/night)
Overall this hotel with the complimentary breakfast is the best deal i ever encountered.
From now on, I will check my travel destination for U hotels and stay there if possible.","October 07, 2019",7,October,2019

Like over 5 minutes I stood up with my daughter as I thought it would take long time for check in.  Later another staff showed up with welcome drinks and hand towel with smiles and asked us to seat on the couch finally . I know it's late hours but how come the staff looks so angry and not welcome the guest at the first time?  She never ask me to seat on the chair just asked me to wait her at the bell person standby podium which I need to stand up. I thought that was the check in reception desk at the first time .  Then later one staff guide us to the room and she told me the mini bar is free of charge for the first round except snacks. All drinks are complimentary but 2nd round will be charged . So I was surprised and reconfirmed with her again "" all free drinks ? But second time will be charged ? "" and she replied me ""yes"" but when I check out the room, they charged me the drinks. The front staff said ""2 drinks are free .and we don't charge you the most expensive 2 drinks (beer) and other drinks you need to pay.

Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"I booked this hotel because the pictures look cute. It's a new hotel so the amenities are all in good condition. In fact, it's so new I think the wild life there are still getting used to the fact that their former homes have been converted into a hotel (I saw a cute little lizard in my room while I was there..... It looked so lost and completely harmless). 

It's weird that I was drawn to the hotel by pictures of the decor, but I ended up hating the decor. It's bordering on tacky. But I'm quite design oriented so that gets to me a bit. The design might be someone else's cup of tea. Just not mine 

Food is good in this hotel. 

The location is a bit weird though. You'll have to go through a series of small alleys to track down the hotel. I wasn't sure if it's safe to wander around the area at night as a female traveller. But I think Bangkok is generally safe so probably not an issue there. 

I would give this hotel a 3 out of 5. Good effort...... But someone it doesn't quite work for me. I do think that the staff are great and you might like this hotel because the staff are amazing.","September 18, 2018",18,September,2018

Bangkok,U Sathorn Bangkok,5 stars out of 5,"Location: Situated away from the main roads, it is not known to most taxi drivers. Out of 5 taxis maybe only 1 of them know how to go. A good way to tell them is the road name itself after saying the hotel name. 

Service: Excellent. Staff speaks and understand English. Their standard of English is also good. They are patient and willing to listen to our requests and do them promptly.

Room Standard: Very Good. Overall it is a comfortable room to stay in but during the stay we found 3 mosquitoes which could be because the hotel is surrounded by trees. Other then that the room is very clean and tidy.

Breakfast: Excellent. Although the spread is small, it is complete. Ranging from Western to Asian foods, there are enough choices to suit every palate. If you have any type of food in mind that is not in the buffet, you may request for it.

Conclusion: As the building is only 2 stories, there is no lift to go to the rooms. We felt this is inconvenient as we had elderly with us. Perhaps a lift shaft could be considered for upgrade. Overall, this hotel is definitely a recommended choice to stay and worth staying again.","December 25, 2017",25,December,2017

In our opinion, this seclusion was great because it meant that we could have a really relaxing holiday while still being in the heart of Bangkok. The best part about this hotel is the 24 hour check in service. This meant that since we had a late check in, we could check out late too - great for night flights!

The staff took all efforts to reach me when our phone was left behind in the hotel showing exemplary service and honesty. The hotel pool is great to relax. The hotel provides a very sumptuous large breakfast spread. Hotel provides a shuttle service to the subway line however recommend to take taxi as a better option.","March 10, 2017",10,March,2017

Bangkok,Cozy Blu Suvarnabhumi,5 stars out of 5,"A real gem, 20 minutes from the airport. Clean uncrowded pool, extremely well equipped room (robes, slippers & pool flipflops), staff charming and efficient. Great Pad Thai from restaurant:, breakfast not gourmet, but plentiful. 
Complimentary shuttle to airport on departure. Set close to residential area - great for a wander past lush gardens, and regular people living their lives. A lot of noisy dogs, but just doing their jobs - none agressive. We enjoyed walking along the canal (just stand aside for mopeds.) As two ladies of more mature years, we felt safe at all times. Thank you Cozy Blu for our wonderful first night in Thailand!","May 09, 2025",9,May,2025
Bangkok,Cozy Blu Suvarnabhumi,5 stars out of 5,I stayed here for two nights because it was close to the international airport where I was leaving Bangkok to head back to Canada. The hotel is clean stop was friendly food in the restaurant was good even though the portion size was a little bit on the small side small swimming pool which I didn't use but others did so they enjoyed it. If I had to complain about anything it was though insulation I guess and not so much their problem but there was a couple of bus tours staying there and leaving super early in the morning and the people were extra noisy in the hallway as if they're the only ones staying there but that's not the hotel's fault. The only other issue was even though they provide a airport transfer for 200 Thai baht it doesn't start till 9:00 I needed to be at the airport by 5:00 a.m. which turned out to be a good thing because the bolt rideshare taxi only cost me 160 Thai baht. And yes I would stay there again if given the opportunity.,"January 10, 2025",10,January,2025

Bangkok,Cozy Blu Suvarnabhumi,5 stars out of 5,"Nice clean hotel, convenient to BKK airport. 
Breakfast was included with reasonable selection, 
Nice pool near front lobby.
At dinner there, and had good Thai meal.
Room is smallish but certainly adequate for a one night stay.
One thing missing, is that there  is not a shelf in the shower for your soap or shampoo. 
Otherwise I give it two thumbs up!","April 01, 2024",1,April,2024
