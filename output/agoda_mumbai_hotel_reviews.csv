I was so stressed and went to your 2nd¬†floor restaurant to have some food to make myself feel better. I meet this waiter I didn't get his name he made me feel so better by talking to me and telling me I will get the handphone back don't worry.

Having visiting mumbai for business, I turn in to bed by 10pm so that I can start my day early. But suffered for 3nights there. Communicated it with the staff but all they had was just apologies and no solution. Party ends at 11.30pm. But then the cleaning starts upto 2/3am. Ridiculous how they manage all this."

Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,"Two day visit early June. Good points: excellent staff and service,  clean and nice room. Restaurant is good, the food variety is good though not enormous, probably more veg options than nonveg. 

To improve: small niggles in the room: bed not precisely alligned, bathroom door difficult to lock, safe having software error, toilet shower having too much pressure, flush water leaking a little.
Overall a good experience!!"
Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,"Room is spacious.
But overall lot of improvements can be done.
Reception staff was not well versed with the checkin process. Initially they have given me in too floor, then due to room door lock issue changed to another floor.
In that room as usual TV was having issue - but the operator came and did the repair and made okay, they were good in work. Toilet also wash area water was not flowing fast, somewhere some block was there.

Bed was cozy, so sleep was good.
Once you are checked in calling for maintenance and waiting for the repair all these are frustrating, better give a well condition room on the first place."

Everything is good except the gym which can be upgraded to include more equipment. My last review was for the gym too and nothing much has changed here from that review."

Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,Novotel stays would always be perfect.  Nothing to complain of.  Novotel staff ensure every single aspect of hospitality is effectively practiced so the guests witness the 5-star experience.
Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,"I stayed on 1st April. The hotel is sparklingly clean and the staffs are super kind.
One glitch was in the food which was managed extremely well by the staffs.

Second stay was from 13th to 17th April.
Again, everything was smooth. But I believe there is a lack of communication between staffs. You need to fix that. I was supposed to get 20% on food and beverages but nothing like that was given even after said that we are allocated the 20% on every food we order from the restaurant. Neither a reimbursement was made. 
And again, there was a major glitch in the food which I don't want to mention.

A 5 star hotel cannot do such mistakes. It's horrible as we are paying a huge sum of money to stay there.

One thing was good that the restaurant in charge as well as the chef came personally to the room to apologize and they provided some desserts which we didn't take as we were not craving for free things but to get the high standards we paid for specially for the food.

Overall, the stay was excellent. I loved the cleanliness.
Some people have commented that they see slums nearby and people just keep staring at them. I will deny this. To me, seeing those slums (small houses) made me feel more humble. We are all humans. Having some compassion in the heart is always good for every kind of people.

I will definitely stay in the hotel next time provided the restaurant staff make sure they don't repeat such a horrible mistake 3rd time with us."

It was like a fresh breath of air after i checked in. The lady at the reception was quite good and friendly. She escorted us everywhere and kept asking if we needed something. 
The rooms were spacious and had a big sofa to lie down. The water bottles were also good in quantity. I loved their bhindi masala subzi from their menu. It was delicious. They even allowed Zomato food and served especially in my room as I was not well. I will definitely visit again in December

Hotel is new

Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,"It‚Äôs good for being a value for money property to stay at. However, I feel that there are much better properties available in the vicinity for just some extra amount of tariff. 
There was a mention of both smoking and non-smoking room at Agoda while booking, however, when I checked-in, I was told that there is no smoking room in this hotel and the designated smoking area was also shut because of rains. I wanted to decorate the room for a friend‚Äôs birthday, but the management caused a lot of difficulties initially as they told me ‚Äòoutside decor items aren‚Äôt allowed‚Äô. The room was extremely beautiful with pretty good room service though. 

My overall rating - 7/10"

Mumbai,The LaLiT Mumbai,5 stars out of 5,"During my recent one-night stay at The LaLiT Mumbai, I was thoroughly impressed by the hotel's grandeur and hospitality. The moment I entered, the expansive lobby captivated me with its elegant design and ambient lighting, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The staff were exceptionally courteous, ensuring a smooth check-in process and offering assistance throughout my stay.
The hotel's facilities are top-notch... Additionally, the outdoor swimming pool offered a serene environment to relax and enjoy the pleasant Mumbai weather. The highlight of my stay was the breakfast buffet at the 24/7 Restaurant. The spread was extensive, featuring a delightful mix of Indian and international cuisines. From freshly prepared dosas and sambhar to a variety of pastries and cold cuts, every item was flavorful and well-presented. The attentive service by the restaurant staff enhanced the dining experience, making it truly memorable.

Mumbai,The LaLiT Mumbai,5 stars out of 5,The reception area was beautiful. Room was spacious and clean. Would have been exceptional if the attached balcony would be accessible but I guess they keep it locked. Buffer breakfast was good and lots of variety. Overall a wonderful experience.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Overall experience is good but food is extremely expensive whereas taste is ok. 3400 for a dinner buffet doesn't make any sense
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,good holet at nariman point
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Hotels in Mumbai are generally quite expensive, but since it was my first time, I chose a well-known and reliable place. It faces Marine Drive, and it's just within walking distance to the Gateway of India (about 20 minutes).

Every time I entered the hotel, there was a security check. The room was a non-smoking ocean view premier double room. From the window, you can see the Arabian Sea in full view. The size was ample, and the amenities were all provided, with additional items like nail clippers and nail remover as well. The flowers displayed were fresh, and there was a welcome fruit basket as well. 

There was a bathtub, but the shower was only fixed and a rain shower, which made it a bit difficult when I just wanted to wash my feet. When I left my PC on the desk, a screen cleaner was placed there on the second day. Even though I left a tip daily, it was never picked up. On the final day, I left a tip along with a ""Thank you"" message.

There is a fitness gym, sauna, and an outdoor pool. I received a 90-minute treatment at the spa. It cost 8,000 rupees for the 90 minutes, which is quite pricey, but it felt nice."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Staff is rude, food is average, facilities are below average, hotel staff have no basic etiquettes. They will change the rooms as per their need and will. Worst hotel ever seen."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Great stay with amazing staff and location....room are all clean...food is also good...location is worth stay for and view is breathtaking...
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,thank you team trident for making it exceptional for us. Special thanks to manager Nikita for going extra mile and providing such a good service 10/10
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It was a one day stay and I can say it was a perfect stay at Trident! The facilities the staff the ambience everything was up to the mark. However there was some issue regarding electricity in the room for a while however except that everything was on point. Breakfast was the best thing the next morning.!
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Had to wait till 4 PM to checkin. They were getting my room ready and didn't even send my luggage to room in time. I had to shout at the staff and then they offered me a different room.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"1) First of all there was only one person at the checkin counter, had to wait long to complete checkin. Process took in excess of 20 minutes to complete.
2) while checkin , my credit card was blocked for an amount in excess of room tariff as an usual practise. However, at the time of checkout the person at the checkout counter denied blocking an amount. I had to search for my receipt to prove, only when the blocked amount was released. The entire checkout process took almost 25 minutes.  
3)  Before I explain my third horrible experience, let me clarify that I, Mr. Das and my wife Mrs. Das had made the reservation for a double occupancy room. During our stay we found the TV in the room displaying ‚Äú Welcome Mr. Nair‚Äù. We ignored it assuming it was a technical error. However, during checkout my bill was showing some unknown Mr. Nair as one of the occupants. The manager at the checkout counter could not remove the name of Mr. Nair from the bill  citing system constraint. I find this  obnoxious and unacceptable.  How can my hotel bill have name of an unknown person, this has security implications, leave aside the document becoming invalid for any reimbursement causing financial loss to me.  I waited for over a month to see if there was an apology or correction  from the hotel management.  Since no communication from the hotel management, I can only pity there pathetic customer sensitivity and poor management control."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,The location is unbeatable with Stunning views of Arabian Sea if you book sea facing room. The staff was also nice and helpful accommodating all our requests. The facilities were nicely maintained which added to our great experience.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"My partner & I had been in Delhi previously and were mildly harrowed by the real-world condition of some of the well-reviewed 3 and 4 star hotels we found. When we arrived in Mumbai, we weren't taking any chances. The Trident absolutely did not disappoint. The location was perfect (there is even a WeWork 5 mins walk away). The facilities, cleanliness and general ambiance were excellent, staff were nothing short of amazing.  To top it off, the ocean view from our room and breakfast made waking up in the Trident a delight, we practically sprinted down to India Jones every morning üëè. One thing worth noting is that you are better off ordering an Uber than having the hotel arrange one (expect approx 4x surcharge). In all, the Trident is a stunning sanctuary for weary travellers in a vibrant, yet chaotic (and wearying) city. Highly recommend!"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,The stay at Trident is a must if you value hospitality. Everything was perfect and at par.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Pure luxury but the room was a bit small for a double occupancy.  The price was a bit at the higher end.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"One had a lovely time while one stayed briefly for a day at the Trident. The slotted room was cozy and had a wonderful view of the sea. The breakfast was sumptuous but one was won over by the wonderful hospitality of the staff, who were ever so courteous and helpful. 

Although I was travelling alone, I felt completely safe and secure."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"One of the best lobbies I've ever experienced - great food, drinks, service, and view of the Queen's necklace (day and night). Rooms interior is a little dated."

Parking can be a challenge as they park some cars on the road while others are underground. This was my only peeve."

Great breakfast by the pool and fantastic staff who do their utmost to attend to food requests. 

The concierge was also very helpful in helping us get around and do some sightseeing. 

Will gladly return and stay again."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We have been platinum members of Trident for a while and our experience with them has only been deteriorating. Perhaps one of the reasons why we have switched over to Leela and Taj. We have stayed with them for over 75 nights in the last 3 years. Their service was exceptionally good in the first 2 years. In the last one year, it has deteriorated big time. Hassle during check in, no call back from the reception, poor service at the breakfast buffet, the list is endless."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"abulous is the word to describe the view from the Sea View room. You get the breataking view of the Marine drive, Girgaon Chowpatty and Malabar hill.
The overall experience at the Hotel is fantastic. The staff is perfect. From Check-in to check-out, the process was smooth. Special mention goes to Frangipani head chef Ishan and our hospitality supervisor Aayush. The breakfast spread was great. The room service was up to the mark. There is an open swimming pool on the Ninth Floor.
As this is located on Nariman point, accessibility is never an issue. Valet parking is available."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,This is a rather faded Hotel where the rooms are very dated and not value for money. No privacy for couple in a bathroom with no doors glass sided.

Saving grace is excellent staff.

Not only that 4 member team was waiting to welcome us in the room, for my son Jeswin it was really a delightful experience.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Amazing Hospitality,  Great Location"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"It was a dream come true to have a staycation at Trident Nariman Point. Having sat at the promenade with my best friend since ages, it was always an aspiration to stay there and look at the queen's necklace, skyline, Arabian sea from a much higher vantage point and what a view it was!

The highlight of the stay was spacious ceiling to floor windows to sit in the armchair and gaze at the Arabian sea and enjoy the view from the comfort of the room. Another was the warm and welcoming service given by almost everyone on the staff. The breakfast buffet was sumptious and delicious.

A suggestion would be to have the pool area open to guests 24*7 or at least till the wee hours of the night so that an insomniac like me can enjoy the cool breeeze and starry view of the sea even at 2 am.

Overall a relaxing, fun filled and excellent staycation at one of the best hotels in Mumbai."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,nice hotel
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Excellent Mumbai hotel with good facilities.  Rooms nice and clean.  Restaurants good with buffet or a la carte options.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Your Reception staff Abdul Hannan was very good attending to check-in and checkout
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I stayed here with my wife for one night. The hotel is located right by the water in a popular part of Mumbai. The room, though clean, was quite basic. We paid USD 275 (including taxes). Breakfast was an ala carte menu of items served buffet style, though you could order off of a menu as well, all included in the room price. Service and friendliness of staff was excellent. Part of the reason for the high price we paid could be that that weekend was particularly busy for the hotels in the area (the Chennai Super Kings cricket team was also staying there). I think the value for the money is not good. You are paying mostly for location."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,a good 5* property with good breakfast and of course beautiful walk on the marine drive promenade.the staff was courteous and helpful.the rooms were quiet.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Family travel is best for the vacation

We love you TRIDENT:)
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"On the Marine Drive. You can just take a walk on the marine drive at all times of the day. 

The food and the overall ambiance at the hotel is great. The hotel is a bit compact (Not much space around) but that is expected in Mumbai. 

All the Staff is very professional and polite.

Highly Recommended."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Everything else is fine until you order food. The minute you order food they will say you can e expect the food to be served in twenty five minutes but it takes ninety minutes to arrive. We had requested bottles of water it took them one hour and four phone calls to get them. Also I had a bruise and I needed a band-aid And I was bleeding quite a bit it took them forty minutes and three phone calls to get the band-aid. also the phones are in poor condition and internet speed is awfully slow!

The hotel overlooks sea and Marine Drive is across the road.  If you don't want to eat inside the hotel, you have plenty of good food joints around it.  Breakfast spread can be better, but the food was good."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Have travelled solo around the world, and by far the best service received. Staff, managers, etc. very helpful, eager to help and will go out of their way to ensure a complete experience. For all this and price paid, 7 stars!"

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Called me after checkout about 20 times while I was in airport and flight due to some billing mismatch. They sent me some payment gateway link that takes more than 10 minutes to fill up.  I would expect this from a local hotel, but not from a hospitality chain like trident. Apart from the great food and well kept rooms, this was not a good experience."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Refused to give us the invoice, they took so much time in solving our queries, the breakfast spread was not up to the mark."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Hotel stay was good, food was excellent and staff was courteous. We got interconnected rooms which helped us as we had small kids. First hotel where they had Netflix!! Negative - there were long queues for check-in and check-out which totally defeated the social distancing concept. We waited almost 45mins for our turn and then another 25 mins checking-in. Then we had to wait for 2 hrs for our room to get ready, till 5pm we just sat around though the hotel did arrange for tea and coffee."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Stayed here for Christmas and had a wonderful experience. Great rooms, staff, dining and facilities."

the level of hospitality and courtesy exceeded my expectations.

exemplary location...."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We stayed at Trident for a night in Dec‚Äô20. The location, views from the room and staff service is spectacular. We were upgraded to deluxe suite which had 360 view of the sea and the city. Views of the sea from the room is magnificient and one can spend an entire day just by being in the hotel itself. Breakfast was also good- the spread was decent and everything tasted good. Fantastic stay and if possible choose deluxe suite or any sea facing room to make the stay further memorable!"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Got a free room upgrade because they knew we were celebrating a special occasion. And thus began a weekend filled with excellence everywhere - from friendly and helpful staff to great food with attentive folks at the other end of the phone. Really impressed.

Thank you Mr Rocky for your excellent reception. Thanks to the staff for their warmth and human touch.t was my birthday on 11.11.....and my bed was beautifully decorated and also offered a cake. It was an extraordinary day and a fabulous stay. It was worth every moment... Money can pay for lots of luxuries but  here its the warmth and sincereity of the Trudent/Oberoi staff that touches my heart always. ..i cannot buy that anywhere. Thank you. ... highly recommend this hotel. 10/10.  Superb
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Stayed here for a friend's wedding. Was really good in terms of location, staff service and handling, breakfast and also the room with its view. Maybe the check in could be improved to be a tad bit faster and the crowd management for breakfast could have been better."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We loved our stay here at Trident, amazing view, great staff and hospitality.  Thank you for upgrading our room without even requesting it, that was so kind of management.  Wonderful breakfast too.  

I would like a microwave in the room though, that would be nice.  I would like to reheat my food, even if it is from downstairs.   Thank you."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Located right on the best part of marine drive. From a high floor you look straight into the water, not road or sidewalk. Staff are super friendly. Buffet breakfast is good with a lot of made to order choices as well. The pan Asian restaurant was excellent. They drop you in a mini Cooper to nearby places such as Colaba or Fort. Or you can Uber it for two dollars"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Nikita was the most pleasant and welcoming person I have ever met at a hotel
She works on the lounge at the 28 th floor

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,The  welcoming staff miss Nishu was very helpful and cooperative as I was allowed a very early check in.. there is  nothing more to ask for.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I had a room on the 18th floor with a great view to the sea. But overall the furniture / equippment was a kind of used. Bathroom with big window to look outside to the room and to the sea. Great. Very tiny bathtub. Could not sit and stretch my legs. Shower only from above.  The 4 elevators seem to have their own logic. Most of the time I ended up in a fully crowded cabin going to a floor I did not want to go. Amazing view from the roof! Nice pool area.
Very friendly staff. Thanks to them.
I had a late Checkout at 3pm cause my flight was in the evening."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Pros...Safe, clean, excellent breakfast buffet,  great service"

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,awesome
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Excellent
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The staff were exceptionally helpful and charming. From the moment they collected us from the airport and checked us in in our room, until we left, they couldn‚Äôt have been nicer or more efficient.  The pool was delightful with lovely views over the sea. The whole hotel felt relaxing to be in.  Fantastic breakfast buffet with delicious food and lots of choice, again great service from all the staff.  Beds were comfortable however we would have preferred a softer lighter duvet.  That said it was the only thing.  Even the shower gel smells good."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The property is great, most of the staff is wonderful, but, as a package, it is unnecessarily expensive.

My wife was visiting me for one night and the charge for stay and breakfast is almost a third of the room rate that I paid. I didn't pay that exuberant a price at the St. Regis, which is way more luxurious than this.

The other irritating thing is that there is always a line for breakfast. Fortunately, I found a faster way by directly going to the Mexican Room. Russell, an employee of the hotel for over 2 decades, was exceptional in his service there. However, the other younger staff is mostly in a hurry and they made mistakes in getting my order of eggs a couple of times. 

One big turn off is that the area under the bed is dusty and dirty - not being cleaned regularly, and, even being overlooked by the supervisors."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"It took over 30 minutes to register. A 5 stars hotel having Nescaf√© bags, the local newspapers was delivered twice but we had to ask for it. We were having  a coffee with snacks, around 12 noon, so whilst drinking our coffee they were cleaning the floor we had to move to another chairs so they could do it. Never, never, I have seen cleaning whilst customers are eating. The staff not that friendly."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"2 nights at the club room for work. Everything was a breeze. Complimentary transport for short rides around the hotel, nicely sized rooms, warm and professional service. I‚Äôd say that the water pressure is gentler than ideal, and it would be good to have a shower handle too (than just a wall faucet)."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,The swimming pool. Excellent location.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We lost of baggage and pyjamas was offered by the hotel staff , we were extremely grateful for the thoughtful act, some of the staff remember us in person and was very friendly . We were very happy with our stay and feel welcomed."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"This is a typical high end big city hotel. It lived up to the expectations one has of a such an hotel. Service was great, food delicious, the location was great and there was an excellent fitness center and salon. We used the fitness center daily and never felt crowded. I had my hair done at the salon and though it was pricey, the service was fine. We especially liked the restaurant. We love Indian food and both breakfast and dinner buffets had a great many choices, all well prepared."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Poor and cheating service, lousy breakfast, disappointing experience overall"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The initial room that I checked into had some issues with bathroom door lock, bath tub, wash basin etc. When I informed the staff, they were very accommodating and immediately shifted me to a different room (upgraded one :) And I was surprised to beautiful flowers and an apology note in the room when I returned. The onsite manager also apologized in person when we were checking out of the hotel. The location is amazing and the service is excellent. I am definitely going to recommend the hotel to my friends and family. A BIG Thank you.

Regards,
Maheen Zafar"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Great location, excellent food and excellent service. Connected to the esteemed Oberoi Hotel, which is more luxurious. Rooms are spacious. However, rooms are quite old and need an upgrade. I recommend you get the ocean view room for an amazing view of the ocean."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Excellent location with amazing view of the Esplanade and pay a little more to get the sea facing room on higher floor with amazing sea view. Walking distance to Gateway of India and surrounding area. Breakfast is sumptuous with good varieties of Indian & western food.  It can do more & better with addition of Asian/Chinese  dishes for breakfast which is lacking at this point. Hotel has a Chinese restaurant which I would rate as average as the dishes name sound appetizing but not as authentic e.g we ordered a ""Popiah"" - Singapore dish but came out as deep fried spring roll."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is located beside the sea, probably due to this reason, the room I stayed was always smelled moldy. The drain of the bathtub was stocked.  But the services in the hotel is quite nice and I enjoyed the meals in the hotel especially the breakfast.

In general, it's a good hotel for staying with high CP."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,This Hotel is A Fairytale!

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Make sure you stay on the high floor with a view of the sea. The view is the reason for anyone to stay here. Facilities are okay, kind of old, and the design is a bit ibis like. 

Staff are nice."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,We stayed here several nights for Christmas last year. The hotel is what you would expect from Trident - great facilities and service. It is not cheap but well worth it for a special occasion. We had a room with the view of the Arabian sea - it was great to watch the sunset. Would definitely stay here again.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,I would like to suggest that you have a link with a local tour company which offers half-day or full-day tours where hotel guests may join  a group tour with pick-up from the hotel.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,For most part it was delight to stay at this hotel. except for one odd day wherein i had to walk out without breakfast after having waited for 45 mins or so ( this considering i had to get to work!) or so and nothing in sight. but I have overlooked that particular incident in light of the next few days when the the servers at Verandah were particular and ensured the delivery.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,once you add all the taxes and other charges on to the basic rate it is quite an expensive proposition

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Stay was quite comfortable. The front desk ensured that they gave us good rooms on higher floor. They also gave us a surprise by celebrating our parents anniversary at the pool side.

Breakfast was good.

However I have a very bad feedback for Agoda. They hid the fact that there will be additional taxes by quoting it in small font somewhere on the site. At the time of booking the room there was no mention of any additional taxes on the checkout page and when I landed at the hotel I was in for a rude shock to realize that I had to pay INR 4500 more than what I thought I had booked the room for. This is complete lack of professionalism on the part of Agoda."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Everyone should try
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Winderful
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Great first stop off on India tour, sea view rooms are definitely worth the price premium. I prefer this hotel to the Taj which trades on its history and in my book is overpriced. Bonus of staying here (formally the Oberoi) is that the new Oberoi is next door with its excellent Zika restaurant. Free 
Mini Cooper rides to local area an added bonus. Would have love to have stayed longer......."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Excellent
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Good pleasant stay only the hotel has a too much professionalism in its approach as certain auxiliary services are charged it is a small thing it goes to show the business mentality as for eg wifi service which should be inclusive has been separately  charged it would make sense to increase their room rates rather than shock the guest at check in
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,EXCELLENT!
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Trident Nariman Point is a twin hotel to the flagship hotel - The Oberoi of the Oberoi Group. Location of the hotel is in business district on the famous Marine Drive. Service is Oberoi Standard and always Excellent. Its a very good value for money.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Comfortable and rightly priced
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,perfect
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I enjoyed myself during my stay at Trident a nariman point. 

Firstly I like the high level of security performed by the staff. Although this can be seen in other 5 star hotels. One of my friends bought a dagger from Amritsar for religious purpose and the Hotel staff informed that for safety purposes they would keep it till we check out. Couldn't agree with them more.

Check -in was fast and we were given an option to upgrade ( to top up the difference) as it came with free wifi. I agreed and also signed up for membership. The room was what I had expected, views of the sea just by lying on my bed. The room was spacious and clean. 

One of the nights, I planned to have dinner at Taj president hotel and enquired on how to get there. The staff went a step further and informed me that he will make a reservation as it could be crowded. I was impressed. 

Location wise, I feel it's near to the tourist attractions which is a short auto ride away. I went to Mumbai during the mosoon period and whenever I came out of the hotel, the wind was so strong. 

Overall, I had a great time in the hotel. I used their gym and was quite happy with their equipments. I would stay again at Trident nariman the next time I am in Mumbai or at any of their sister properties in India."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Perfect stay...warm welcome,professional service and care and comfort was outstanding
Concierge Mr Rocky Saldhana was outstanding with all his assistance and warm hospitality..the staff were remarkably pleasant. 
Mr Chanthrakanth at pool n gym was also extremely polite,caring and  warm personality..I could see the dedication 

It was a few days of paradise at this hotel."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,good
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Stayed with my family - wife and 2 daughters aged 16 and 14.
Best service standards that are hard to match - Iconic property with breath taking views of the Marine drive and Mumbai skyline.
I am confused about the Trident branding.... really wonder whats so special about THE OBEROI next door?
I feel the rooms have got a functional, business like look to it to fit into the TRIDENT branding."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,good.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The hotel stuff and the reception were excellent.
The rooms were very clean and in perfect condition.
It was a pleasure to stay in that hotel"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"It was alright. The rooms were small and I didn't like the breakfast timings. That should be mentioned at the time of check in. Most hotels I have stayed at were till 11:30 atleast. Also, they didn't provide a smoking room when they mentioned that they would."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Always a pleasure due to staff hospitality and overall service
Location is excellent and best in south Mumbai"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Not impressed with the rooms
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,After many years as a regular guest the front doormen still discriminate base on the type of vehicle one arrives in and on colour of skin. When I arrive in my friend's Inova there were four doormen talking to each other but not one came to welcome or ask for the keys as I walked into the lobby. Went out again to hand my car key and the driver drove off without unloading my luggage. NOT A GOOD PERFORMANCE AT ALL !
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,had a very good stay
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Pleasant and comfortable stay. However inspite of availability of ocean view rooms, our request to be moved to one was not entertained."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Pleasant
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We had a pleasant stay at the hotel. We are offered the standard upgrade for Club Room + Wifi + Airport Transfer for Rs3500 per day but we decline. We were alternatively offered an upgrade to sea view room for a small fee. We happily accepted. I think the Wifi charge of Rs1000 per day is not suitable. I can get my mobile data roaming for USD12 per day which is half the cost and available everywhere I go in Mumbai. For Rs1000, I am only enabling wifi during my limited hours in my room. Wifi should be made complimentary like most hotels or offer basic access for free and premium access for a fee. During checkout there was a mistake of billing us for one breakfast and I need to use Agoda voucher to show my room charge include breakfast. They front desk cancel this item in the bill after I show them the Agoda Voucher. In general, we had good stay at this hotel."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,We were disappointed by the service and the sense that you needed to give a generous tip in order to be well served.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,I booked in for my parents. And they enjoyed their stay there. The breakfast was fantastic. They had a room with the Ocean View. Location was perfect. The best part of the hotel is the customer service. The staffs of Trident Nariman Point were too good.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,I was generally impressed with the hotel; staff were very helpful indeed. The room was very comfortable with a good shower. Breakfast was of a good standard with many options.. I really enjoyed Mumbai and it was nice to have a calm refuge away from the hustle and bustle of the city...only issue was you had to pay for WIFI. This should have been included.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"One of the good hotels in the area. Our stay was comfortable and peaceful, much due to the friendliness and helpfulness of hotel staff. Overall feel of the facilities that hotel is in a good need of refurbishment and renovation. Rooms were clean but all the amenities look old and definitely not up to 5 star hotel standards. Food was delicious and the location of the hotel is one of the best in the area. We would give it total good 4."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Good Stay!!
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"In my previous five visits to India, I never managed to make it to Mumbai. So, I decided to spend the weekend in Mumbai before head off to a class in New Delhi. My original plan was to stay at the Taj; but the Trident had a promotional offer that was too good to pass up. I am very happy with my choice! The Trident Hotel is sleek and modern with a spectacular sea view. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more professional and helpful! Upon registering, I was offered an upgrade to club for only RS3,500 per night. Usually, these offers are rip-offs; but in the Trident's case it was a great bargain. For my extra RS3,500 (GBP 35) per night I got: a room with a great sea view, breakfast in the club lounge (The breakfast is made to order, not a buffet under hot lamp deal.), h'orderves and drinks in the evening, a free airport transfer that the staff allowed my to trade for a free four hour private tour of Mumbai (BTW, the tour was excellent.), free WiFi (I hate paying for WiFi. There's no reason in this day and age why all hotels don't provide free WiFi for their guests. In a five star hotel, charging for WiFi is mercenary!), and finally express checkout on the club (28th) floor. My room was great. The only criticism I have is that the drawers were small. I am not a clothes horse; but I bet a lot of travelers who book five star hotels are. Also, I was traveling alone. If I was accompanied, there would have probably been some contention over draw space. This is a very minor problem that the Trident can easily fix. The location, Nariman Point, is perfect. If you don't want to eat in the hotel, there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. If I ever return to Mumbai, Trident Hotel Nariman Point will be my first choice!"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,I have found non better in this location
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,ok
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Wonderful,  I was there to celebrate my daughter birthday,  n they bought a surprise cake n flowers for my daughter with birthday card in my hotel room with all their staff.  It is really very nice of them n appreciating."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"This is a very good hotel, paradise in Mumbai and best scenic views of the sea!"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"always a pleasure coming back to the hotel
good in all aspects
staff especially friendly and efficient
everything good
Keep it up"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Mr. Vikram Oberoi, If you read this I'm very disspointed with your Check-in Counter staff and Manager on duty during my arrival. My Mother and I have to wait for 75 minutes before we were able to check-in. None of your check-in staff give me an update about the status of the room and your manager on duty is invisible. The good side is clean and well maintenance for room, attentive and friendly housekeeping staff. Good security and the hotel looks lively when Mumbai Indian team is around."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,fantastic we celebrated my fathers birthday with fun and joy in comfotable ambience and very friendly staff to help and serve. outstanding hotel
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Great - we arrived early in the morning and were given early check in and upgraded to a superior room with a sea view. Staff was pleasant,attentive  and unobtrusive. Thou roughly enjoyed our stay here. We were even late check out."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Lack of free wifi in rooms
Room furniture is dated and needs upgrading"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It was for a short business meeting. The stay was comfortable and had a chance to relieve my stress with a visit to a local spa about 5 mins walk from the hotel.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Great location. Clean room. Fitness center (Though the equipment were a bit old)
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,EXCELLENT HOTEL FOR THE 2 DAYS SHORT VISIT. ROOM SERVICE WAS VEEY FAST WHICH WAS THE MOST SATISFYING EXPERIENCE.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Good - Spacious clean room. Great breakfast, near enough to walk the distance to the Gateway of India, the Taj Hotel (also the ferry boarding point for the Elephanta Island). Similarly to the main shopping street. Great roof top pool - wished we brought along the swim gear.

Not so great - only staircase access to the breakfast area (below the level of the lobby) that we are aware of - makes it difficult to get there - I had recently injured my knees)."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I was upgraded on arrival, which meant I had a higher floor view and a superb room.  Staff were attentive and helpful, breakfast was varied and delicious, and Club facilities were excellent.  I look forward to my next stay here in this hotel on the sea front.  Enjoyed walking to Kala Ghoda and Fort from here and along the sea front to many neighboring restaurants and shops."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I loved this hotel.  Spent one night and wished I had booked 3.  Outstanding staff - fabulous comfortable room with every modern convenience including electronic black out shade and CD player with flat screen TV.  Lovely bathroom with great products and even a plate with oranges, linen napkin and knife on the desk when I arrived.  Excellent value.  Verandah lounge was nice with a buffet - small finger foods etc. for a good price and again, excellent quality of food and service by staff.  Late checkout until 6pm at no extra charge.  Nice but cold rooftop pool with comfy lounge chairs, plush towels.  Steam room and change area with bath and hair products.  Everywhere was exceptionally clean for India, most impressed.  Highly recommend this hotel."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I have stayed in Trident Mumbai a few times before. I was always happy and comfortable there.    The staff are excellent,service is very good,and i am very comfortable.When I am in Mumbai again i would choose Trident again.A big thank you to all staff of Trident Mumbai.Bye."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It was good value for money for the amenities provided. Unacceptable that there was no free wifi for all guests.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We took for the package that includes breakfast. But the receptionist denied for breakfast finally we had show them the booking confirmation then they allowed us. It wasn't fair. At same time staff weren't rude. 
All are small compact room and very small bathrooms
Only ocean view is splendid"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"it was perfect right from check in till check out noticed friendly staff , allowed late check out , had nice break first and last but not least on request provided the best ocean view room with city look as well....it was worth all money and for sure i would like to visit again ..."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It was great - I would definitely stay here again.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,its worst i hope and decided not to stay again in this hotel i belive there are lot of best hotels in mumbai has good srvice  good facalities with nice hotel staff.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,One of the best hotels in Mumbai.  Central location and very helpful staff.  Breakfast was delicious with many options.  The pool was great and the gym inside the hotel was top notch.  Would stay here again and again.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"the trident is a very clean, modern hotel in Mumbai, close to the shopping district.  Friendly staff and excellent room service, great ocean views"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We stayed at the Oberoi for the first week of our holiday which is next door to the Trident. We decioded to try the Trident as a comparison for the last few days. Whilst not of the standard of the Oberoi, we couldn't really fault anything. Pleasant room, excellent ocean views and a great swimming pool although extremely cold. Excellent location on the ocean front on Marine Drive - easy access to Colaba Causeway etc via taxis which cost pennies. Staff all extremely friendly and helpful. Preferred the location of the Trident to the Taj Mahal. Would stay again."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"friendly and helpful staff,high security,fast check-in and check-out international menu at breakfast and dinner.In overall I would recommend this hotel for short stay"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,stay was good service at reception was great location was good but the service at breakfast was very slow...many complaints from guests regarding waiting time for a cup of coffee or tea
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The stay was excellent. The Staff very helpful, definitely deserves a 5 star rating, the rates just need to be at least 15% lower"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Trident Nariman hotel is very probably one of the best hotels in Mumbai but at affordable price.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Very comfortable stay. Great location. Good view of the beach. Nice staff  clean . Good bathroom with power shower. Niigata breakfast. Wifi should have been included especially as it was a business hotel. Less star rated hotels offered free wifi.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It was great.  The initiative they take as they even brought a cake for my husband on his birthday in which I didn't inform them of anything.  It was really a surprised and the thought that counts.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,overall experience was fair and OK for Indian standard (due to poor infra structure and my personal experience of other so-called 5 star hotel in India)but way below standard of hotel in US and other asian country.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Relaxing and friendly stuff there no noise at all. Swimming pool area and meeting rooms are very good
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Pretty cool..had gone for a quiet time-off from the daily schedule and the calmness and service will help you just do that..relax..food is good and the location is ideal..on the marine drive and close to the night life centre..al in all value for money if you get a good deal
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Trident Nariman Point Mumbai Hotel absolutely exceeded my expectations. They have the best customer service I have ever experienced in my travels. I had to check-in earlier than the usual check-in time because of my flight schedule and because I had to wait a bit for check-in, hotel reception was kind enough to give me complimentary wifi services as well as free lunch buffet! Aside from that, all hotel staff were very courteous and attentive to guests' needs. You'll really feel like a VIP in every corner of the hotel. Also, the hotel's breakfast buffet has a very good selection of food. When staying in Mumbai, Trident Nariman Point Hotel will truly offer the best hotel experience you could ever ask for =)"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Really enjoyed my 24 hours of relaxation at Trident.  Sea view rooms are beautiful as is the swimming pool deck.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Traident is a very nice hotel in Mumbai facing the Sea and the Rooms very Comfortable with excellent Room Service and a very friendly and comforting staff
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"i really enjoyed and spent my time in mumbai and for comfort reason, trident was the best"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights.Initially I booked in Trident Nariman hotel but when I checked in, I was upgraded to a nice ocean view room in the Obroi hotel which belongs to the same hotel and adjacent to Trident. This is a good gesture from the staff. The staff performance was outstanding during all times. The food was great specially the breakfast. In general, this is the best hotel I have ever seen since long time. Highly recommended to all. I will with no doubt going to stay there again."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,it was very nice; staff were pleasant and helpful and facilities are top notch
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Apart from being away from the city and taking almost close to an hour, it was an excellent hotel. Good staff service, good restaurants and modern and spacious rooms."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The view from 27 flr from my room was like me standing on the edge of titanic spreading my arms and i could feel like i am flying.
The things which lacked was:
1 no comb - which a 5 star hotel should provide to guests
2 no dental kit- which i called room service to provide
3 at the time of check-in the reception guy asked me which new paper i would prefer and i wasn't deliver any."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,I have booked this hotel in the past also and there has been no issue.. But this time the only problem I faced was that the package clearly said 'breakfast inclusive' which apparently wasn't. I paid for my breakfast separately.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"it was a wonderful stay as always, would like to stay whenever i am at Bombay.  Would like to spend few nights with my wife at Trident"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,They at least still provide smooking rooms but I think I will not stay again!
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"while check in the staff was very helpful.Breakfast in the morning there was many variety.
But while checkout it was a very bad experience because I have booked from 22nd August to 26th August.I have checked in on the 23rd in the morning and checked out on the 26th @ 3 oclock in the morning,I have been to the desk where no additional reclamation was made to me.I was getting in my taxi when suddenly somebody ran after me by telling infront of everybody that I have not paid for 1 day.I was hummiliated infront of my wife and security guards.Finally the desk manager came and appologies on behalf of her staff.But as we always say in FRENCH (LE MAL A ETE DEJA FAIT)Infact I have booked for 4 days but stayed for 3 only"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Good stayed, clean room, strategic located, and friendly staff"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Hotel is right on Marine drive and pretty accessible. 30 mins to Bandra. Parking is limited and they neither provide nor recommend accommodation for your driver. In the end you will have your driver sleeping in your car which is parked outside the hotel, which means your driver might be tired the next day. I recommend they should have some guidance for safe parking & safe accommodation nearby.

Check in was quick, view from room nice, staff is very attentive and helpful, knowledgeable and polite, make you feel comfortable, handle special requests well. Great training there it seems.

Room had a comfortable bed, desk, chair and the amazing view. Fresh fruits complementary and the tab water is potable - that must cost a fortune! Room had a bathtub with shower which was nice. 

Our room was not cleaned properly, hair and peanuts of the previous tenants on the floor, no toothpaste in the bathroom, etc. Was a bit of a surprise...

The lifts suck. Not that this is a big issue but we were not the only guests who were not quick enough to enter or  who missed their stop as the lifts stopped randomly or who stood in the lobby while all lifts were on the top floors.

We had a stroller which means access to the breakfast room in the basement is via the service elevator. Good fun for us but I am sure tough for old people who can‚Äôt climb stairs, etc. Also to get to the Oberoi there are a lot of stairs and no other access.

Breakfast was good but I don‚Äôt understand why a seafront hotel would have two restaurants in the basement!?

Location good for a stroll. 

Nice place, recommended if you want to spoil yourself for a day or two."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Client Service, Location & Hotel Quality is really Excellant"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Trident was the first stop on a recent India trip.  It's a large business hotel but central to the main attractions in Mumbai.  Located on the sourthern end of Marine Drive, the principal museums and historic quarters are a quick taxi ride or a 15-30 minute walk away.  The fitness center is very well equipped and the pool has a great view of the Arabian sea.  Very well maintained with an obliging staff."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"As usual the staff service was excellent
Room is very good
Toilet is just slightly small but very well designed so there is no problem as such
Good choice of resturants,shopping and old business disctrict nearby
Overall good in all aspects"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"A really pleasant stay. This is a real 5 stars hotel with a fantastic service, clean room and great room service.
A cheaper alternative to the Taj hotel."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,We were upgraded to the oberoi which is next door and the same chain and had a very pleasant stay
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We were there for our first year anniversary.  Hotel was nothing special like we were hoping for.  For any other occasion it would have been nice.  For the few extra dollars, we wish would have stay at the Oberoi which is right next door and much nicer.  Staff tried doing something nice knowing it was our anniversary and bring us a cake.  Unfortunately they thought doing so at 23:45 was a good time to do it."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Great hotel, it was very convenient and the staff were incredibly helpful and kind. The breakfast was delicious and the fitness centre had new equipment and was great. The only downside about this hotel is that they do not provide free wifi, and that the taxis that you order from it tend to be more expensive."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"It was a wonderful stay as always. The hotel staff at reception was very polite understandable and very receptive. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel, would like to have room facing sea next time.
The floor towel in the bath room kept needs to be changed as the same was torn on all four sides."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Overall a great stay. The hotel and rooms are nice, restaurants are great. I had a small accident as one of the staff cleaners rang the bell and before I could tell anything he opened the door - and I was about to change. I complained about the accident and the supervisors were very apologetic, offered me flowers in the room and chocolates."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I enjoyed my stay at the Trident, would definitely recommend for business travellers"

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I have been staying at the Trident since 2005, and I have never once been disappointed about the service, rooms or the cuisine."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"This is a really amazing hotel and our stay here was great! The concierge is incredibly helpful. Only two negatives - the price for Internet access is quite high but this seems to be common at hotels in Mumbai. Also we contacted the hotel to see if they provided transport from the airport and we were quoted 3526 rupees - considering a taxi costs 600 rupees, the hotel's price was very high. But we would stay here again"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Neighbouring room was loud at 4am till we complained
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We had booked Trident as we wanted a relaxing stay and enjoy amenities and good food.  Its closeness to sea, also gave us an opportunity to enjoy the sun set."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Would recommend this hotel for a stay in Mumbai .Close to sightseeing activities.  Taxis are cheap but negotiate price before getting in.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"too good love the place, people, weather and hotel is too good."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"i really enjoyed my stay at the Trident Hotel, Mumbai, its the only Hotel I would stay in Mumbai, very clean and neat, value for money"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Firstly we did not stay in the Trident. On arrival we were informed the hotel was full and so we'd been moved next door to the Oberoi. Which really was an upgrade. Oh my word. It was fabulous. We were treated like royalty and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. One of the best and most luxury hotel experiences I have ever had. It's not cheap, but definitely memorable and very very comfortable. We had booked without breakfast at the Trident and got breakfast included at the Oberoi. So all in all it was very much a good deal for us. We loved it."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The management was excellent.Our flight was in the evening,they generously allowed for a late afternoon check out.The service and friendliness of staff made our stay memorable."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,internet was very expensive - five star hotels should include free wifi
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"the problem that u must pay for the internet , the location and room condition are excellent , its very clean inside rooms, very large lobby and fast check out , i faced a problem that room was not ready inspite i arrived at 3 afternoon"

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Fantastic. The staff was wonderful, the food (breakfast + dinner) was great, the pool was amazing and the room spotless. We will stay again!"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"This is a well located hotel in the Colaba area of Mumbai. Morning walks along the sea front are easy and relatively quite (for Mumbai). It is in the tourist part of Mumbai so close to Gateway of India and the shopping areas. After a day out in the chaos of Mumbai, it is a real pleasure to return to the peacefulness of this hotel. The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed. The restaurants serve great food. The staff are friendly and attentive. All round a great stay."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"- very comfortable beds
- very good TV and amenities

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"being in nariman point, south bombay is as classy as it gets in india. but u can forget about travelling to other parts of bombay without passing through hell traffic. FYI the coast line is just full of wavebreakers but it's a good place for a jog or, in the local slang, ""timepass"".

as for the breakfast... get in line. even when you get a place u are forced to share and have a kooky face time with strangers.

buffet dinner is good and recommended"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"prompt check-in and check-out, courteous and helpful staff"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,This time i was with my family and kids. All of us enjoyed the stay and hospitality by hotel. It was great.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"i really enjoyed my stay here for 2 nights. service is excellent. rooms are all one can expect and have al the amenities. the facilities are great, especially the gym, which for a hotel is about as good as it gets. i wish there was a beach. the ocean is fronted with more of a barrier and rocks. no sand. and having to pay us $/day for internet is frustrating anywhere, but certainly not necessary or expected in india. most travel surveys say the #1 gripe of travelers is having to pay for internet. trident, are you listening? food is good but also overpriced. but all that said, i'd definitely return."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"i stayed in 3 different 5 star hotels in india on my current stay sun and sand,novotel and trident, being the biggest of the 3 the service was super quick, rooms clean and athmosphere 5 star. will return in future again."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We had an amazing experience staying at Trident Nariman Point. Our room was on the 30th floor and even though ours was a city view room, from that up the sea right outside our room. Its a perfect place for a romantic getaway. The location is amazing, u step outside the hotel and there's the marine drive and u can see the famous 'Queen's Necklace'. You can take a stroll in the morning or at night by the sea . The hotel staff is readily available and can cater to any needs that u may have. The morning breakfast spread quite lavish, specially the bakery goods. There are plenty of places to hang out in the area as well. I highly recommend this hotel. Absolute value for money."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I was surprised that wifi was not free!!!
However I had to talk to the Manager in charge to ask for complementary wifi, which they gave me right away.
So, I guess this is a pro and con.

The service are of high standard.
The food specially breakfast was very nice."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Although the Staff were very friendly and always smiling and ready to help with any querias. I found the modern  bathroom very difficult to function. The taps were difficult to use and not user friendly. The privacy was a point of contention although they had blinds to close the bathroom.

Otherwise a very enjoyable stay."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The Hotel is an Ideal location for business traveller and lots of places to visit nearby.
Good service from the staff and efficient in handling the request.
Good restaurants in the hotel especially the Breakfast spread good.
Travel time to airport on a working day is about 2-2.5hrs and we almost were late for our flight."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Awesome location looking over the Marine Drive very cordial staff good restaurants n luxuriousness in its every aspect.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,the hotel is located along the scenic marine drive facing the sea. ideal location for visit to the commercial centres and tourist areas in the old city. service at the hotel is great and you will find very helpful staff. the lobby does get crowded during the mornings. restaurants are good  and can enjoy a hearty breakfast.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"This is the best hotel for those who like modern hotels. The location is perfect on the beachfront. It is a lovely walk from the hotel to Chowpati Beach. The service is of high standard and all guests are treated like VIP's. The restaurants are excellent too. The swimming pool is the best, with a magic view of the whole bay."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I had a great stay and the staff did their best to sort out an issue I had with Agoda!
I had mistyped the booking date and the staff make huge efforts to help me with it!"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"One of the more popular business hotels in Mumbai for a reason. The room rate was good value for money, check in was quick and efficient. Location is right on the sea but also in the prime business district. On site restaurants are expensive but top-notch. There is also a good shopping arcade within the hotel. Rooms are modern, very clean, and tastefully furnished. Wish the WiFi was free."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Everything was great all staff members hotel room service food all great up to the mark
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"very nice hotel joining the oberon.
it is a good spot to start seeing mumbai from.
the food and facilities are good. they have an excellent gym.
very easy to get a taxi and see the southern part of the city.
maybe a bit pricey for a 4-5 star."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We had a great stay. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Our on-line check-in for our flights was very ably done for us by the staff. My daughter's reporting time for her flight was several hours before mine. I wanted to see her off at the airport.The conceige made arrangements with the ITC Maratha Hotel, which is close to the airport, so that I could spend time in the comfort of a Hotel after seeing off my daughter before I could check in for my flight later on that night. Moreover, my daughter and I were allowed to occupy our room much beyond the checkout time as we were not due to depart for the airport until late that afternoon."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"During my short stay there, me and my friends got ripped-off by a cabby who had covered the already run-up meter with a piece of cloth at the beginning of our journey unbeknownst to us. When we reached the destination he sprang a surprise ripping us off over 5-times the normal fare.

The next time for my airport trip also another cabby tried this ruse but got earful of me. The concierge was totally unhelpful.
 
The hotel management can't be unaware of this rip-off. Guests expect a honest cab service inside the hotel. Trident management should curb this blatant exploitation as it spoils the otherwise wonderful experience of the hotel guests."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"This is the 2nd time I've been to the hotel. And as usual, they were top notch. The room, the location and the service, I wouldn't grudge. But the food is just fine but not something you would go gaga over. Not to mention its very expensive. The complimentary breakfast on the other hand is a delight... they have something for everyone, though their south Indian dishes could do with an overhaul.

That apart, I had a nice stay. Will visit again, though this hotel is more designed for business travelers."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I have been to the hotel many times during my previous visits to Mumbai but it was our first stay there. We were delighted when we arrived at the Hotel as the vibe was great. It was lively and if you like ""people watching "" this is definately the place. 
The room was alright except that the aircon wasnt working too well. After much complaining it was only on our final night that they offered a change of room, by which time, it didnt really make sense. 
We visited 3 of their dining establishments where service fell really short. It was rather shocking that they were so short staffed especially in a place like India. The coffee place at the lobby really fell short, they couldnt even deliver a decent cup of tea and the tea had to be sent back as it was cold when served. The whole experience of having tea and coffee took about 1.5 hours not because we were chilling but simple because we were not served. We had a better experience at India Jones. Service fell short again at Frangapani ( where breakfasy was served ). Again they were short staffed and simply couldnt deal with the crowd which is surprising as they are a big hotel and should expect large numbers. 
I would return simply because of the location and vibe but would definately not patronise the dining establishments."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We stayed for 5 days. Right from the get go the staff made our stay special. We got complimentary club room access. 
The room and view were excellent. The room itself was extremely clean and well appointed. The bed was very comfortable as well. 

We had a very good experience overall. When I went to settle the bill there was a confusing charge for soda, since we'd been sure not to touch the mini bar. Not only was this removed, all charges for water were taken off as well!

We had some friends over and a glass was broken in the shenanigans. It was cleaned up within 5 minutes after the call to housekeeping. 

Housekeeping was very prompt. We went out a lot, and every time we came back our room had been cleaned. 

Just a great experience overall. We had a very pleasant stay. Thank you for the memories!"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It was a memorable stay. Good Hospitality extended by the hotel staff. The only not so good experience was the waiting time for breakfast. Space is less and people were more
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We arrived very late after 5hr flight delay. Upon arrival, the staffs were very helpful and proactive. We were surprised that we received a free upgrade to the upper level hotel Oberoi, which is next door and internally connected.
We had meals in both Trident and Oberoi hotels, the food were great! The staffs in both hotel are fantastic. The location is right near the beach line with a long beach walk, which is good for morning and evening exercise."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We stayed at Trident for 3 nights in December 2012 as we wanted to see the nearby attractions and also to avoid the crowded parts of Mumbai . Trident Nariman point is situated in a not so busy business district compared to other Mumbai areas. The bedrooms are spacious , clean and comfortable.
The hotel staff were very good especially the restaurant staff. One staff I would commend is Negraj in Frangipani restaurant; he was excellent as he served us very well during the breakfast. 
The housekeeping were also good especially the housekeeping supervisor Maria Cruz who provided us with the information in visiting shopping places in Mumbai and also helped my wife with her laundry. Thank you Maria.
The concierges are very busy due to a high volume of guests arriving and leaving and therefore did not provide us with the service we had expected. Also the concierge arranges taxis to the airport and fixes the price with taxi drivers.
Buffet style breakfast was included with the room and it was very good. They had all types of options available."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,The staffs are friendly and helpful. Feel safe and very relax. Wifi is not free but it's not that expensive. The buffet at Frangipanni is also nice. Highly recommended.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"very high standards indeed all around, couple of things to note:
the internet/wifi is not free as was advertised on this site.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,The best hotel I have stayed in Mumbai. The employees are incredible! The room and amenities were wonderful.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It's one of the good hotel at mumbai we ever visited.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Excellent stay. Purified water was a big plus - only time out of around 6 trips to India where I haven't got ill. Hotel location great for exploring South Mumbai (and walking to the Wankhede Stadium). Staff all very helpful and friendly. We did suffer inconvenience about needing to change rooms after 1 night due to some booking error, but resolved very well - all 3 of my party were upgraded to suites. I would definietly recommend the hotel to others."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The rooms are spacious,clean and all staff helped to all our needs. Food at the restaurant were very good, above my expectation, however bar prices are high. Beautiful hotel with a great location."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,I had business trip to India and stayed here. It was luxurious and the room was totally clean. The location was also pretty convenient for the business traveller as it was located at the center of the business district. I highly recommend it.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"lovely hotel connected via a shopping centre to the Oberoi.

Was in Mumbai to watch the cricket so it was an nice 10 minute stroll down to the ground.

Extremely dissappointed in the hotel policy to charge for internet access (this is however the case for all the top end hotels in Mumbai).  I believe that a 5 star hotel should be offering it as a core part of their service and not treating it as a money making opportunity."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,The service of the hotel is very good and the staff are very polite. The room is spacious and clean. We enjoyed watching the sunset at the poolside and also at the lobby where there is a guy that plays the piano very evening.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"an excellent hotel in a great location and not very expensive for mumbai 5 star standards

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Wonderful terrace facing the water with in the pool area - they should have a bar though serving drinks outside.

A lot to see around."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"We had a fantastic time staying here.  The rooms are great.  The gym and pool are both very, very nice.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Awesome rooms with awsome view, breakfast buffe has limited spread but what ever options are available are delicious.
Staff is very courteous, extra ordinary service."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I was freely upgraded to a sea-view room, which I must say, was worth the money. Check in was quick and hassle free... I was OK with a smoking room initially as I do smoke occasionally, but unfortunately it was too ""smoky"" and claustrophobic for me. I asked for a change to a non-smoking room and the staff were extremely polite and nice enough to immediately find me a non smoking room, and that was the right decision! Beautiful room and a grand view from the 32nd floor greeted me... 

That apart, their breakfast is definetely better than other 5star hotels and me and my wife never missed that! The food service through in room dining was quick, and the food was better than expected. So kudos to them on the kitchen. Bit pricey, but guess not so much different price wise from other 5stars again. The opium den(their pub) was again a nice affair. 

We stayed 4 nights as a couple and we found the hotel neat, very clean, with nice food and great service.  Ofc apart from the fabulous views. Would visit again and I highly recommend others too..

P.S: It looks and feels like a business hotel, which it is. It can be more romantic, given the location."

Thank you so much!! I could have very comfortable stay in Mumbai."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is nicely located with good service. However, the food was hopeless even at Frangpani, which is known for its fine italian cuisine."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Hotel is located besides Marine Drive and near many popular local attractions. The swimming pool has a great view. Hotel room is clean with adequate space.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"right from the moment we stepped into the hotel we were greeted by one friendly staff member after another. we had made a request to get a corner room on a top floor and had no problem getting it. the hotel is incredibly plush and very comfortable to stay in. i have stayed in hotels in san francisco, london, dubai and singapore, but have never received the kind of personalized service this hotel offered me. the staff at this hotel is more than one notch above what i was used to.

a small word of caution. we booked a room package with breakfast here on agoda but when we checked in we were told that breakfast was not included in the charge. it was not a big deal and after showing them that breakfast was in fact included in the package rate, they quickly agreed to it. it might be useful to give them a call before checking in and confirming your package.

i am definitely going to be staying at this hotel again. i have a trip planned in january again to mumbai, and would not dream of staying anywhere else."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,breakfast spread was good. First class service. Highly recommend n would love to stay there again on my next trip.

Over all a nice experience"

Decent hotel though"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"i enjoyed my stay at the trident nariman due to the location of the hotel to some wonderful sights, the quality of the food and the helpfulness of the staff. i do think that the quality of the complementary cocktail could have been better but the staff did everything they could to make the stay very pleasant indeed."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"the mumbai indians, the indian cricket team, use this place as their base. had no interest for me, given i know nothing about cricket, but i guess it's an indication of the quality of the hotel, the service, the security, the facilities, the sum of the parts of a hotel really.

it was my first visit to mumbai, and i was surprised that the internet recommendations all seemed to recommend 5-star places, as i normally prefer boutique/cheaper places. so we bit the bullet and booked trident, and i'm very glad we did. we were given an upgrade without asking for one, securing us a lovely corner room with two views over the water. the food downstairs was great, the staff exemplary, the tourist attractions and business area in comfortable walking distance (for us, aged 30ish, maybe too far to some tourist attractions for older tourists). 

i'd recommend it highly."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Stayed 4 nights.. on the first 2 nights i was delivered freshly made chocolates in the room. These were lovely.
on the second two nights i did not recieve the chocolates, upon asking the service staff, they said its only for guests who stay 4 or more nights and chocolates are only given on the first 2 nights.. sniff sniff lol..
Service was very good throughout. Staff are friendly.
Overall i would say one of the best 5 star experiences in Mumbai."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Got upgraded to beautiful club sea facing room-was great experience
Hotel quite flexible about late check out-very courteous
Nice selection of resturants and bang in middle of south mumbai tony area
Hotel is recommended
It is expensive but then so are all hotels in Mumbai and this hotel offers all the necessary facilities for a very comfortable and good stay
would recommend this hotel for all and any purposes
also near all shopping etc"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Lovely hotel. Great staff. Excellent location. Good food.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"service is very satisfying, both in the front office and in the room. I was given late check out after the receptionist know my flight at midnight. they rent a local simcard, a thing that foreigner cant have.
the restaurants provide a very tasty menu, i only try two restaurant. 
but, theres no free wifi, even at the public area."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,We had a perfect stay at this hotel.  We got a great price and got bumped up to a nicer room when we got there.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The room was beautiful and spacious.  The location was perfect.  Would also definitely recommend eating at India Jones in the hotel- awesome meal.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"i really enjoyed my stay at the trident. we had a wonderful view of marine drive from our room and it was a 5 star experience in every way. the staff were attentive and friendly, and the food was also excellent. i got a deal on this hotel, and it was considerably cheaper than other 5 star hotels in south bombay."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I spent a few hours in the hotel room, freshening up and relaxing.  The rooms were business smart.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The 24 hours restaurant was good.  All in all, a pleasant stay."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Great property and centrally located. Clean and great service.
Fabulous concierge who go the extra mile."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The staff were ever-helpful. I've never had anyone said ""no"" to my requests - including free late check-out and a driver to the airport who charged within my low budget (over-spent on shopping). Breakfast was delicious and do not miss the Trident spa. It's not the cheapest spa but really nice. Also, do pay a bit more for a seaview room. The charming Arabian Sea sunset is too romantic to say no to."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It was a good stay as the room as well as the washroom were very clean and very friendly staff.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Smooth check-in.  Clean comfortable room - very comfortable bed.  Free fruit, coffee/tea and unlimited water.  Taps have drinking water too - so no plastic!  Cons are expensive room service, huge and impersonal, outdoor pool too windy and cold to use."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Great new rooms and the resturants are the top in the city
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"the hotel is very nice, very warm hospitality... very great staff... very friendly and helpful..room is very clean and decent...worth for 2nd visit"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"What a great place to stay. View is fantastic, room was lovely and staff were great"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"I only stayed at the Trident for one night, a quick business trip to Mumbai. I arrived in the early hours of the morning so it took less than 1hr for the taxi to reach the hotel. I booked a hotel car back to the airport, again later in the day (about 8pm) and it took 75 minutes... in the rush hour it would probably take much longer. The location is fine if you have meetings in that part of the city, and plenty of time to catch flights, but otherwise I might stay in one of the hotels closer to the airport.

The hotel is obviously expensive compared to most others (although not the most expensive on this site) so my expectations were high. The staff were friendly, and check-in was efficient. The hotel room was fine (I was upgraded to a sea view)... the hotel room was a little dated for my tastes, it would benefit from upgraded bathrooms etc. 

The internet was not free (it seems that the more expensive the hotel, the more likely they are to charge for internet access)... someone needs to tell them that free wifi is now expected by most travellers. 

There are a couple of restaurants in the basement, one only opens at 7.30pm... (the same time the buffet starts in the other) so maybe not great if you like to eat early. The a la carte is available all day... and was fine for me as quite suited to western tastes (a tuna sandwich and a pizza... I was playing it safe...)"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"i have stayed several times in this hitel and i was never disappointed in the quality of the services, cleaness of the both the room & the toilet, friendlyness of the staff & best of all the location in nariman point.  this location is near almost to everything except for the airport. it is located in the heart of the city near the important businesses & near most of the shopping area.  moreover, the shopping arcade within the hotel offers great shopping experience if you do not have the ample time to visit the city, prices are little higher but bazzar like atmosphere is common where you can negotiate almost anything. 30%-60% of the orginal price can be settled for."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,This is a great hotel very conveniently situated for all local tourist points of interest just a very short taxi ride away. The hotel has a very pleasant relaxing atmosphere and the staff are very pleasant and helpful. The club room we stayed in was excellent with a great view of the bay the only downside was the bathroom was rather small. The condition of the swimming pool is looking a bit old and could do with updating We would definitely stay again.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Trident Nariman point is an excellent business,leisure hotel and hotel for all purposes located in marine drive south mumbai's poshest location

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"there is nothing i can say that was not 100% right in this hotel. the fact is , i am sure this hotel will get so many positive feedbacks it will become too popular and reservations will be hard to make ...or maybe price will go up. for this reason i leave it up to you to explore this hotel . enjoy your stay in mumbai !"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The staff remember me and know what I like , every time I am there I get the same service and smiles.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Great location with very good view of the indian ocean. i was very delighted with the fact that they upgraded me to the executive floor without further charges. I would recommend eating in the hotel as the food is good and not pricey. the hotel is excellent for business travellers as it is located near many companies
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,the double bed was sloping towards either side causing instability and discomfort. The pillows were huge and uncomfortable.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"we buy voucher from agoda travel , trident is a comfortable hotel to stay for business trip . near to go craw ford market, but diffucult to call taxi. we must have rent the taxi for convinient,   nice swiming pool but not have sauna."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,It was great.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,We had a great stay at the Trident and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a place on Marine Drive in Mumbai.  The hotel had a great ambiance and the service is great.  The rooms could use an update as the furniture/carpet looks a little tired but everything within the rooms is still really clean.  I loved the gym as well.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"always nice to come back to this welcoming hotel with great resturants and very nice rooms, its price isnt too bad as well.....i found a great deal on agoda."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"My wife and I came to this hotel (then named Oberoi) years ago for a nice afternoon high tea, which we enjoyed very much. I didn't realize this until staying at the hotel for a few days. It made this stay a second delightful memory of the Trident Hotel."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"This hotel is beginning to show its age but still has a relaxed charm and cleanliness ideal for India.  The choice of venues within the hotel is linited - frangipani restaurant is excellent, india jones is average and the bar is characterless.
The lobby area is noisy and busy so nowhere private to meet."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"The first thing you like is the way people grant you with smile. Spacious place, clean. For people who work in finance you are ideally based. On 6 meetings I had, 5 was less than a minute walk !!!
See sight give you also a good way to come back."

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Nous avons s√©journe une nuit avec une copine lors de notre visite a Mumbai. Emplacement parfait ! chambre de bonne taille et petit d√©jeuner tres bon.

Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,une seule phrase : √† recommander!
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Es war fantastisch!
Ein Aufenthalt hier an bester Lage ist grossartig, alles perfekt, es gibt nichts zu bem√§ngeln."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Cooles Hotel!!
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Fragte zweimal f√ºr ein gro√ües Bett anstatt 2 Einzelbetten.
Leider erfolglos!!
Auch bei der Bestellung kreuzte ich 2mal diesen Wunsch an. Auch dies erfolglos
Alles nur leere Versprechungen!!!"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Leider haben wir den negativen Stimmen zu wenig Beachtung geschenkt und trotzdem ein Zimmer im Trident gebucht. Das war ein Fehler. Denn das Trident ist definitiv kein 5 Sterne Hotel. Wer mit uns nicht einer Meinung ist, sollte bei n√§chster Gelegenheit unbedingt einmal im Four Seasons, im Oberoi oder im Taj Mahal Palace logieren.

Unser Zimmer konnten wir erst nach √ºber einer Stunde Wartezeit beziehen und mussten dann feststellen, dass die R√§ume weder aufger√§umt noch gereinigt waren. Das Housekeeping musste mit zwei Personen volle zwanzig Minuten nachreinigen. Hinzu kommt, dass unsere Suite (Room No. 3234) bereits weit √ºber das Verfalldatum hinaus war. Die M√∂bel sind zerkratzt und abgewohnt, Bez√ºge teils dreckig und speckig, der Teppich fleckig und ausgefranzt. Das Bad hat schon bessere Tage gesehen (Schimmel, Flecken im Lavabo!) und die Klimaanlage liess sich leider nicht richtig regulieren, so dass wir w√§hrend der Nacht gerademal gef√ºhlte 20 Grad im Zimmer hatten. 

Die Mitarbeiter sind bem√ºht aber auch schnell am Anschlag und zum Teil mit allt√§glichen Situationen restlos √ºberfordert. 

Das ganze Hotel ist stark heruntergek√ºhlt und in den √∂ffentlichen Bereichen (Bar, Restaurants, Lobby, etc.) geradezu unangenehm kalt. Man ben√∂tigt Jacke und Schal, damit man nicht friert. 

Das Essen wiederum war sehr gut und von hoher Qualit√§t. 

Auch die Poollandschaft ist sehr gepflegt und die Bedienung aufmerksam und professionell.

Wir k√∂nnen das Trident trotzdem nicht weiter empfehlen. Dies ist kein 5 Sterne Hotel, weder beim Gesamtauftritt, bei den Angeboten noch bei den (nicht!) erbrachten Services. Das Hotel ist in die Jahre gekommen und ein Stern dabei wohl abhandengekommen. Die Angebote f√ºr Zimmer und Suiten m√∂gen attraktiv sein, summa summarum aber trotzdem den Preis nicht wert."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,ruhiger Fels in der Brandung der hektioschen Grossstadt
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Perfekter Auftakt fuer eine Indienreise
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Sehr angenehm, genau das richtige zum erholen nach anstrengenden Besichtigungen. Schade war nur, dass der Pool so sehr kalt war und das WiFi extra teuer bezahlt werden musste."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Im Vergleich zu einem europ√§ischen 5-Sterne-Hotel waren die Zimmer nicht vergleichbar: eben nicht makellos, aber ordentlich. Unverst√§ndlich ist, warum der Pool nicht ein bisschen geheizt wird; das ist im Dezember in Mumbai durchaus angebracht. Man wird auch nach 10 Minuten durchkraulen nicht warm. Ein Gast sagte mir im Dampfbad, dass das der Grund f√ºr ihn ist, nicht mehr in dieses Hotel zu fahren.So weit w√ºrde ich nicht gehen, aber es ist nicht 5-Sterne-Standard. Die Gegend um das Hotel ist ruhig, wenn man das mag."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"W-Lan kostenpflichtig -- f√ºr ein 5 Sterne Hotel inakzeptabel.
Noch dazu zu diesen hohen Preisen."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Obwohl um 3:00 morgens angekommen, sehr freundliche Aufnahme. Zimmerservice hervorragend, Klimatisierung sehr gut, ruhige Zimmer auch wenn umgeben vom Familien mit Kindern. Restaurants bieten morgens, aber auch sonst, eine Vielfalt an kulinarischen Gen√ºsse f√ºr jeden Geschmack. Im gegenteil zu mir, mag meine Frau keine stark gew√ºrzten Gerichte. Wir waren beide sehr zufrieden. Auch die musikalische Einlage des Pianisten abends in der Lobby vermissen wir jetzt schon."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Man kann schoen am Marine Drive laufen und Sonnenuntergang geniessen. Zum Taj Mahal Hotel/Gateway of India ist es ca 1/2 Std zu Fuss. Um die Ecke ist ein Kinocenter und Restaurants.
Man sollte das Fruehstueck mitbuchen, das ist relativ teuer im Hotel, oder man geht zu Fuss und fruehstueckt in einem Caf√©.
Wenn der Preis stimmt, wuerde ich immer wieder kommen."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,Ich habe im Trident sogar besseren Service als in deutschen 5Sterne Hotel erlebt. Das Personal ist bestens geschult und macht alles moeglich. Es gibt keinen Wunsch der nicht erfuellt wird.
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"Im hektischen Gro√üstadtdschungel von Mumbai braucht man einen sch√∂nen, sauberen, freundlichen R√ºckzugspunkt, z.B. das Trident der Oberoi Gruppe!Vor allem die Concierge Mitarbeiter waren sehr hilfsbereit bzgl. Adressen und Tischreservierungen sowie Tipps f√ºr die meist sehr schlecht Englisch sprechenden Taxifahrer.
Das Zimmer war gro√üz√ºgig gestaltet, der Pool samt Sonnenuntergang sehr sch√∂n!!
Auch das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffett war sehr gut sortiert f√ºr jeden Geschmack der internationalen Klientel mit freundlichem Personal.
Im S√ºden der Stadt gelegen ist es nur eine kurze Taxifahrt zum Taj Palace Hotel am Gate of India. Hier spr√ºht die Stadt vor Energie und hier kann man durchaus gute tour guides durch Mumbai finden. Auch abends ist die Gegend abgenehm zum Spazierengehen und Sich-treiben-lassen. Wir haben den Aufenthalt rundum genossen, im Verkehrswahnsinn der Stadt ist das Trident eine ""kleine angenehme Oase""."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"kompetentes Personal
sehr erholsam nach dem Sightseeing"
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"die Atmosph√§re des Hotels ist sehr gut, die Mitarbeiter sind sehr freundlich, sehr gutes Fr√ºhst√ºck, Lage des Hotels f√ºr Mumbai optimal, Mitarbeiter gaben sehr gute Tipps f√ºr Ausfl√ºge - in unserem Fall stellten sie die Verbindung zu reality-tours her, um eine Fahrt in die Slums zu machen, sehr guter Service auch bei der Abreise. Am Abreisetag konnten wir uns bis zum sp√§ten Abend im Hotel und auch im Poolbereich aufhalten, da unser Flug erst um 2.30h ging."
Mumbai,Trident Nariman Point,5 stars out of 5,"die vorhandenden sicherheitsvorkehrungen fuer dieses hotel, bishin zu mit machinengewehr hinter sandsack burgen postierten soldaten war zu naechst ziemlich gewoehnungsbedurftig. nach relativ kurze zeit fuehrte diese bewachung zu einem angenehmen sicherheitsgefuehl. (anschlaege im november 2008). es war sehr einfach ein taxi preisguenstig mit einem  englisch sprechenden fahrer zu bekommen.es    wird sehr die snackbar in der lounge des hotels fuer fruehstueck und zwischen mahlzeiten empfohlen ."

Mumbai,Sahara Star Hotel,5 stars out of 5,This is a popular hotel with some good dining options. Located very close to domestic airport terminal in Mumbai. In general rooms were clean and had all basic amenities. Staff needs to check that all plug points are working as we charge multiple devices these days. The hotel lobby also needs some more seating/ sprucing up.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I booked this as a treat of for 2 of my friends and they had the worst experience ever! 
We were unpleasantly surprised and disappointed at the standard of the room & services , especially at a hotel like the Taj, which has a stellar reputation of unparalleled luxury! My guests room in the Tower section of the hotel had bedbugs! My friends who went back to a family member‚Äôs home in Bombay was getting her clothes washed when the maid noticed the bugs! They had to get everything in her luggage and the whole house, including the curtains, bedspreads & cushioning boiled, steamed and then laundered! Though age had spotted bugs along the paneling on the walls, she didn‚Äôt want to create a big deal till she got home and Mainly because she  didn‚Äôt think that they would have got into her luggage! To top everything everything off they can‚Äôt even make a decent milkshake by the poolside! Even after informing them  that they haven‚Äôt stirred it well and that the cocoa is all stuck to the bottom and that it all you get through the straw is cocoa, they didn‚Äôt attempt to redo it or to offer us another one and they made it exactly the same way the next day as well! I‚Äôm appalled that though we have informed them, nobody has gotten back to us!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The service is the first thing I want to write about. Absolutely impeccable!

R. ALMutawa From   Kuwait"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Taj Mahal is the best one in the area and My favourite for relaxation they have the best spa ever
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Well worth the experience. The hotel has a rich history and amazing architecture that has last the years. Service was top notch and staff were really attentive. Nothing to fault! There were different wings to the hotel and some parts were undergoing refurbishment with minimal disruption to guests. Our room faced the Gateway of India too hence we got to see the traffic and experience the bustle from our balcony. Food at the restaurants were great thus one didn't need to head out to try the various cuisines if you chose to. Loved the experience and stay. A recommend!

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj Mahal Palace is an impressive Grand Hotel, how you imagine it should be. Location, service, view, stuff - whatever you are talking about.
Only disadvantage are the prices in the restaurants - they are also grand. Especially if you compare it to the price level around. But overall a must in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The hotel was superb. Attention to detail was 100% and the staff were delightful. The buffet breakfast had something for every taste in the huge choice on offer. Pool area was very pretty. Also very high level of security around the hotel.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Excellent location, Knowledgable and courteous staff. 
Could be more helpful with the facilities and services. Overall they were very nice but need more activities for small children and entertainment."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,very good
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The place is good, but didn't like the food , the pay more attention to "" How the dish look"" than  the taste of the dish"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Taj created a wonderful hiatus in time

We were cared for, looked after and pampered 

After meandering through 84 countries, all of which God created in their own individual beauty, it took Taj to show us a genuine patch of perfection

Thank you

Alex and Usha"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Lovely place, food and drink are grossly overpriced, clean & tidy, pleasant helpful staff.  But for upmarket hotels I think Raffles in Singapore just has the edge on it!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is steeped in history and magnificent, the location is brilliant, however the prices are exorbitant and the room was not cleaned properly from the last occupant.....there was toe nails on the floor."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Your staff were beyond excellent.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"From the moment you arrive there are warm welcomes and many unexpected extras. We were upgraded to the magnificent heritage palace wing and everything was catered for, even before you realised you needed something, it was there. Yes you do pay more for everything, but the service, surrounds and attention to detail are worth it for a special treat. Our only slight negative was the quality of food at the Golden Dragon, which claims to be a Sichuan restaurant, but falls a little short of the mark."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Luxury accommodation
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Beautiful hotel which 100  years of history. Professional well trained staff make the experience even better.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,If you want to experience something very special than visit this place. History goes along with an outstanding service and beautiful views. Take a room in the old part of the hotel which is more expensive but so much more unforgetable. If you have a chance get a room with view of the ocean and the gate of India. A great experience will wait for you!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Friendly, professional, comfortable; an excellent hotel - we will visit again"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Sumptuous rooms. The heritage tour was very interesting.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is a magnificent establishment, and I'm pleased my group decided to stay here for a night after having spent 2 weeks trekking through the Himalaya sleeping in tents! We were a bit embarrassed arriving with backpacks etc, but the staff were wonderful and we even received upgrades. My only disappointment was our stay was too short!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj Palace hotel is one of my best hotel experiences thus far.  From the moment I arrived I was made to feel special by the hotel staff.  My stay was during Diwali 2016 and the hotel as adorned is Diwali ornaments and decorations.  At the reception desk, Priyanka greeted me with a smile and was extremely helpful.  I had an early check-in and she upgraded my room.  Thanks Priyanka.  My room came with butler service and provided fresh fruits which I requested.  The rooms are spacious and well designed.    A staff member escorted me to my room and made sure all was just right.  The property is gorgeous and not far from many attractions and sightseeing i.e. India‚Äôs Gateway.   Overall, great staff, rooms, service, and location.  I really enjoyed my stay at the Taj Palace Hotel and look forward to my next stay when I‚Äôm back in Mumbai."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was so beautiful stay & wish we could stay longer.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our superior king city view room was in the palace wing of the Taj. The charm of the palace wing is unmatchable. The team did up our room with lovely decor & filled with balloons since its our wedding anniversary. We even celebrated with a small size chocolate cake, compliments from the hotel. 

My wife had a pleasant surprise when the room attendant Keton & housekeeper Saksham left a pouch of indian accessories on the desk. She was delighted as its in time for our dinner at Souk. It matches her outfit too!

In particular, we enjoyed having breakfast at Shamiana instead of the Sea Lounge as Magalhaes was always there to brighten our mornings.  His service is commendable!

Taj is definately an experience you will remember and we are looking forward to coming back. Oh I almost forgot...u must join the daily tour of the hotel. Don't miss it."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Nothing here is a problem for management or staff. All performed beyond expectations and nothing was to much trouble. We received a most unexpected upgrade to a suite and when asked why, ""because we can"" was their response. The food and wine was varied and fairly priced. We ate at the Indian restaurant which was fantastic, excellent service. Breakfast buffet was outstanding.  Nothing was out of place and if you intend going to Udaipur this is a must. Beautiful. We will return and recommend it highly."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The room pictures and room were completely different. You had suite pictures for a normal room. The room service had the worst pasta I have eaten in my whole life. Disappointed as I am also an inner circle member of the last 6 years.

The evening tour was particularly interesting & informative.
Breakfast was sumptuous & service superb.
Every corner of the hotel exudes charm & grace.
The Taj is not somewhere to sleep, it's an experience.
Thank you."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We had the best time ever!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We really enjoyed our stay last weekend. Kids enjoyed it the most. Not a complaint but more of a feedback is that pool could be little more kids friendly (depth was a bit high). A game room or recreation room would have been great as well.

Loved it regardless!!!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent in all aspects!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Perfect
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Location of the hotel is just too beautiful and coupled with the impeccable service offered by the staff is just too good.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,I have travelled a lot and always stayed in a variety of Hotels but there is none to beat Taj Mahal Palace  Hotel in Gateway Mumbai.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,I cannot fault my experience at the Taj. The stay was amazing...
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is beautiful. Lots of heritage and character but modern finishes and comfort. We loved the pool, breakfast, all the restaurants were good and the location was perfect as a first time tourist in Mumbai.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fantastic
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj Mahal Palace is obviously THE place to stay in Mumbai but it lets itself down on a couple of minor points that shouldn't happen in a top class hotel.
The extras details in the bathroom were a bit basic and the safe was too small to take a small size laptop. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Lovely gardens and pool. Superb location."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent night
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our stay at the Taj was absolutely superb.  The staff are very polite,  friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good with a variety of food. The room was clean and very nice. We enjoyed our 2 nights at The Taj and look forward to staying there soon."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The only negative was the bad quality of wine and drinks. The internet was also very slow and we lost the connection all the time. The breakfast in the Sea Lounge was excellent!

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It's a magic place.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Everything about our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace was superb. However, we were disappointed by the description of the view from the bedroom window!

We  booked a ""Deluxe Harbour View"" room but the only way we could actually see the 'harbour' was to put our faces up against the window and look to the right, at which point we were able to see a corner of it. Standing 'in' the centre of the room, the view was of a wall of the new Taj Mahal wall which stands in front of the 'old'. Had I known this was to be the case, I would have booked a different room.

Whoever wrote the view description had a very inventive mind!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Hotel most accommodating for our early arrival and a late departure. Take the free daily tour of the hotel to learn about the building and some history. Staff very helpful.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had requested a non-smoking room in the tower. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a suite in the Palace, however, we were not informed that it was a smoking suite. Not good if you have asthma. Other than that, we were satisfied."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"From booking in through to leaving all staff seemed exceptionally well organised, friendly and eager to please.   The stay at this hotel was a delightful and memorable experience."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We had the most amazing time the staff were excellent and location was perfect for our first time to Mumbai we plan to revisit I'm October.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is fantastic in every way. It's an impeccably well run hospitality oasis close to most major attractions in Mumbai, and great shopping.

The staff is professional, prompt and highly discreet. The food is excellent, as is room service. The gym, spa and hotel pool are well maintained - in particular the pool is an experience of its own.

I can't say enough about this hotel. As someone who travels about 150 days a year all over the world I can say with confidence that this is one of the very best hotels in the world."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was awesome
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Service, location, room, breakfast, atmosphere everything was excellent! I will be coming back!"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We encountered serious problems in the hot water pipeline wherein rusty water with metal chips kept coming the room till we had to call the technician. Certainly not expected with Taj. Rest of the experience is wonderful as you can expect it in this hotel....Will visit again but hopefully we'll have no troubles like this time....
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent hotel.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Near Perfect

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Beautiful, couldn't have stayed at a better hotel to round off my 30 days overseas. Staff were very competent and extremely polite and friendly.

Breakfast was ample with a large variety to serve all tastes. Well done, I'll definitely be back to stay at the hotel."

I think I will only stay here when visiting Mumbai in the future.

Great experience all round."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a wonderful stay beginning with a very personal and efficient check in process, and continuing with superb service all through our time at the Taj. The ambiance of this hotel is truly unique. The location overviewing the Gateway of India is fantastic and a high level floor with view towards the water is definitely recommendable.
We enjoyed the Palace Lounge as a tranquil sophisticated retrait also very much.
All in all, the Taj is THE hotel in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is a beautiful example of colonial architecture.  I stayed in the old wing which was superb however a friend that I was traveling with was in the new wing and experienced multiple problems in the room such as AC, Windows, noise of construction etc.  staff service is generally of a very high standard however it is variable and inconsistent particularly around the pool area."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Unbelievably good stay
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I can say that during my visit to Mumbai,  staying at Taj mahal is my best experience.  Mumbai it self is not tourist friendly. 
The location very strategic,  the room very big and comfortable. 
Staff service is very good,  especially staff at restaurant while breakfast. 
This hotel also is a historical building, that's why for first timer in Mumbai, you must stay here. 

Unfortunately the restaurant inside is very expensive. We try the Japanese restaurant which cost usd 150 for 2 person for a little order only. 
Anyway, I would come back here again"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My son and I stayed for two nights and had an extremely enjoyable stay.  The staff are wonderful, the room perfect, pool lovely and breakfast delicious.  It's perfect, old-fashioned luxury with the added benefit of no-one trying to be too cool - just welcoming and helpful.  I will definitely stay again when we're next visiting."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"can't understand why no breakfast for booking a 5-star hotel, and the wifi speed sure as hell doesn't match the name of a 5-star"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Very comfortable and relaxing. We were greeted by all staff who we passed by either walking along the corridor, to the restaurants, shopping mall etc. This time it was 2 nights next time will stay a bit longer. Worth every penny,what a surprise upgrade to Taj Palace."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fantastic
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Outstanding hotel

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Made a reservation with Taj for pick up at the int  airport early morning at 5, worked wery smoothly, at 6 a clock il was walking in to the reception.
Had a room with city view. Comfy bed all product you need in the bathroom.

Il love the pool area. The pool man help you to at sun bed and provide you with thowels and bottle of water. If you need a locker room to change go down to the spa, there you allsow will find steam room and sauna.

TAJ  have several different restaurants and my favorite I Wasabi, next time I'll will only order dumplings, they are so tasty.

The breakfast buffe is lovely with everything you need.


Il be back in January 2016."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"From the moment the family walked through the entrance and were greeted by the staff we knew we had arrived somewhere special.  We were personally escorted to our rooms by Zeena, who looked after us superbly throughout our stay.  We were travelling with young children who were amazed to find their room decorated with balloons and gifts.  The rooms within the Palace were just a delight to be in as was the constant attention to detail from the turn down service to the beautiful rose petal designs left in the room after cleaning.  Its obvious that all the staff love working there and it really is an Indian Institution that all should sample.  We can not recommend this hotel enough."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I had a great time, the Heritage Trail was an eye opener"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We are business travelers decided to stay for three nights in Taj Mahal hotel and we make reservations via agoda but when we check out the one from reception stuff want to change me more than my bill which as we know for agoda police the price which shown in vouchers is the finel price 
And this stuff refuse to under stand 
And I answer hem I have agoda vaucher from agoda which i follow it an all my reservations and I book in agoda befor 7 years and I didn't face any problems with any certain hotel"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is amazing, is an historical place in Mumbai in the heart of Colaba. The hotel is amazing and very luxury. 
Be careful one detail, this hotel have 2 buildings, old that is really crazy amazing and new that don‚Äôt have any novelty. Check to book a palace room as that part of the hotel is 100 + years old.
The service is very good, all staff are always happy. The only that I didn‚Äôt like too much was the breakfast, anyway is just a personal feeling, but is 5 stars anyway, and the internet cuts a lot, but the rest, this hotel is perfect. 100% recommended."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent location. Probably the best property in Mumbai.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The service at this hotel is over the top. I have stayed at over a 100 hotels in 50 countries in the last 6 years and I would rank the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai as #1 in service, luxury, comfort, food quality and style.

Ohhhh my god it took almost 2 hours with reception manager it was wonderfull experience super time üëçüëçüëç"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"the stay was ok. Not what we expected from the Taj Mahal. The place was crowded, maybe because of new years' eve."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Wonderful, superb, They came to know that its our marriage anniversary and we were amazed by the gifts , cake, champagne, flowers. Not only this my kid was taken care also.. Dance class for him, then drawing book for him so that he enjoys his stay.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Great stay for those who want to be treated like royalty. Everything was great. My only reservation was that they were too attentive, we were asked if we needed anything about 10 times in a day. A little tiresome, but everything was great when we actually did need help with packing a parcel. They provided everything we needed. All in all, it was great, the room was nice, the breakfast was delicious, staff were very accomodating, the location was perfect for most tourist sites. Highly recommend this place. Thank you!"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I have been visiting india and particularly Mumbai for most of my years, generally on an annual basis and especially in the last 8 years each time visiting another city and returning to mumbai.
I have stayed in hostels in dongri, in bhendi bazaar and new bombai. Each time experiencing something new, but I know that now I will find it really difficult to stay anywhere else.
The Taj is more than a home away from home
Thank you from the bottom of my heart, but my purse does not feel the same"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"It's my third time in Taj Mahal Palace , and I got the chance to stay in the palace section this time with my wife , she really enjoyed her stay and asked me to take her back to it again. Mumbai is one of the cities that I really love and can't get enough of. The Staff is friendly and the breakfast is good. Taj Mahal Palace will be always my first choice whenever I am in Mumbai"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,A step back in time. One of the world's classic hotels.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fabuloud
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I cannot rate this hotel high enough. From a luxury point of view, it is amazing and the hotel is beautiful. But the service was just incredible and is what sets it above others. We arrived about 5.30am and we told we could pay a half board to have the room ready by 7am. This gave us time to have breakfast in quiet surroundings with a personal butler. To continue the great service we were upgraded to the Palace side which I would recommend paying more to stay in anyway. Each night we came back to our room to find personal gifts such as cake, silk scarves, Indian jewellery and one night 2 foot bathes were set up for my husband and I - the water was promptly delivered for us. Just what we needed after walking a lot in the heat. Relaxing in the pool each afternoon was also wonderful, and again the service by the pool staff was fantastic. Compared to other countries, the prices for accommodation and breakfast was very reasonable and so worth it.
In Mumbai, I would say go to Leopolds for beer and cheap curry, good fun and great taste. To upgrade a little, there is a local restaurant not far called Khyber - best Indian food we have ever had. 
With the help of a Dharavi local based tour company, Mystical Mumbai, we had an eye opening tour of the slum which we recommend. Make sure you check the taxi meters are on and you can rent a taxi for about 350 rupees an hour. Colabar Causeway is excellent for bartering for anything and the local shops along here, although generally fixed price, are still very cheap for well made Indian cotton clothing."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Truly magical stay!

Service was beyond compare and whilst expensive to stay represented superb value for money.
The ambience through the entire hotel was amazing.

We ate twice at the Masala Kraft restaurant and the food was simply fantastic, the Sketch menu was outstanding value as it was cooked fresh in front of you at your table and the Chef explained everything to do with the meal.

It is hard to put in to words how wonderful the staff were. From the front desk and check in to the house staff to the management...everyone was dedicated to ensuring a wonderful stay.

The Palace wing is steeped in atmosphere and ambience and was amazing.

As we were in the Taj Club section and were very lucky in that the hotel upgraded us to a suite we also had the high tea element, free cocktails, free cognac & chocolates and free tea and coffee throughout the stay in the Palace Lounge. A free transfer from the airport to the Taj was included as was breakfast.

The stay was not just a highlight of the trip but to be honest a lifetime highlight as well!

We simply can't recommend the Taj Palace enough, it is a truly magical hotel providing a truly magical stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a fabulous time and look forward to our next visit, unfortunately next year"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,nice
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Delightful. It was a special treat , from  friends and lived up to the occasion."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We flew to Bombay with friends to stay at the Taj, after seeing the 3 part TV program in UK.
It was brilliant if you are in the Palace wing, definitely 6 star, but the Tower wing has miserable, small, cheaply furnished rooms, hardly 4 star.
F&B is very expensive. One wine, which they sell in their own shop, is 7 times the price in the restaurants."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Simply say, this hotel is 10 stars hotel. They know how to touch people's  heart regarding all aspects which guests expect from hotel while staying."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Everything was convenient in terms of hotel service, location."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Actually, this is the best Hotel in the downtown area of Mumbai. The world-class service and food are remarkable. But be aware if you are a light sleeper, you can hear some traffic and other guests in palace wing, depending on your room.
Opt for the garden view. :)"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Stayed at the tower not the palace but the view of the Gate of India was great
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,perfect
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Among the hotels that i have stayed so far ,this hotel is magnificient in its service from the rooms and its staff.i enjoyed the breakfast buffet its was fantasitic."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was a lovely stay and got thoroughly spoilt. Will stay there again for sure if we ever happen to go to Mumbai again.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My husband and I came for three nights. We were impressed by this beautiful building and the rooms do not disappoint. The concept of service is taken to a new level here, with rose petals left in the room, extremely helpful staff, tours and staff falling over themselves to help you. For those worried about the water and traveller ailments associated with India, the taj has its own water purification facilities. Even the shower water is potable. Highly recommended. Just a note for first timers, there are two sections of the hotel - the tower which is new ,and the palace which is the regal, historical section."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Wonderful, would like to come back"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent stay. the recent renovations have made an amazing hotel even better. I will stay again on my next trip to Mumbai

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we had a wonderful time at the Taj - it felt like being home. A family atmosphere, super friendly and helpful staff and a great ambiente. Just the right place to relax and enjoy a beautiful location and also to participate in a lively city. many major sites are in walking distance and you can choose one of the many boat trips right in front of your door step."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Perfect
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent.  Staff were great.  Hotel spa is exceptional
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a wonderful experience on a whole but unfortunately the room that we had got was small in size. However, it's the quality that matters and it was really upto the mark. The luxurious lobby and the world class shopping experience is sufficient to pamper yourself."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Overall we had a fantastic stay, Mumbai was our last stop of our family trip to India, brilliant way to end a great holiday, Mumbai is one of the nicest, and the best places we visited in India..
The hotel was lovely we had 2 club rooms, in the Palace. My only complaint was that both at breakfast and during the cocktail hour we were kept waiting to enter before we could enjoy the facilities, however the timings were up held so if the cocktail hour was until 8 and you weren't able to enter the club room till late (due to lack of space) they would still stop serving at 8 which I though was a bit unfair, all guests should be accommodated accordingly, same with the breakfast, the sea lounge couldn't accommodate everyone at the busier times so you could be kept waiting outside for up to 20 mins, one of the mornings the buffet was being cleared away before we had even finished (the staff did let us know that this was about to happen but they had already started clearing it at the very same time so we didn't chance to enjoy breakfast properly) they did apologise after I complained. Again I didn't see it fair that after having had to wait (which I didn't mind) but then, that they would not then extend the timings accordingly allowing those guests to enjoy breakfast fully, they were very apologetic about this, I'm not sure if anyone else had complained about this but with all the attention to detail and high quality service I felt these were 2 areas (quite important though) do need looking, apart from this our stay was brilliant... my husband fell ill, they organised a doctor very quickly for us (who was very good).. oh and lastly I have to say how amazing the building tour guide was, unfortunately we cant remember the guys name, but he was fantastic!!So knowledgeable and entertaining!!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is a lovely hotel, we could have stayed longer. We will be back same time next year."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was meant to be a one off treat for me but having now stayed there I can never stay anywhere else if I go back to Mumbai. The little touches were just fabulous!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Like to stay longer and would come back immediately. Awesome hotel
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Simply superb! You will not find another hotel that has this level of attention to detail, this refinement of staff, and efficiency of facilities. Situated in the heart of Colaba, this hotel is truly the crown jewel in the Taj Hotel group's offerings. Thank you for an amazing stay!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We stayed high up in the tower with fantastic views overlooking the Gateway to India. The room was very comfortable and well furnished. The hotel has so many shops and places to wander around or just relax. Our only negative is the Relatively high price of drinks at the bar.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"A truly Taj Experience, Outstanding Hospitality. The hotel staff takes good care of their guests. Location is awesome in South Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,One of the most beautiful and comfortable hotel I have ever stayed. Everything was so good that I can easily say they can classify themselves as 7 star hotel.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Got free upgrade to palace wing again !! You guys are just awesome
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Great
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,After the hustle and bustle. The Taj is a please you can relax.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Amazing
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I couldn't have asked for a better first-time visit to Mumbai.  The Taj certainly lives up to its reputation as one of the best hotels in the world and my stay there made my trip to Mumbai even more special.  The warm care and service I received from the staff exceeded my expectations and I couldn't recommend this gem of a hotel more strongly.  I requested and was upgraded to a room in the palace section of the hotel which was utterly charming.  Should you ever have the opportunity to stay at this legendary hotel, do so.  It will be a very special experience."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Staffs were really nice and helpful.
Lobby was well-decorated.
But the room condition and breakfast were not superb as my expectation.
The hotel is a bit old, but the historically wealth for staying."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Great staff, friendly and helpful.
Fantastic ambience and a great history 
Very comfortable rooms and thoughtfully architected ."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,First class
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The staff were very helpful; friendly and professional. The upgrade of our rooms was the cherry on the top. Will definitely stay there again on my next trip if the rates remain reasonable
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"A hotel with excellent location. The room was modern, had very good facilities and the staff were friendly and accommodating. The location of hotel is on main road with good access airport and Mumbai shopping area Choice of bars and restaurants within the hotel is excellent. The staff made the difference service with a smile.  Enjoyed the stay and will definitely return."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I couldn't resist such an iconic opportunity. My wife didn't know I booked the Taj, and when we pulled up at 1am her jaw dropped. We spent 3 magnificent days in the ""old section"" which had a great mix of traditional architecture and modern comfort. My wife commented everyday that this was the best hotel experience ever. The staff was constantly doting on us, the breakfast over-looking the water or the pool were equally wonderful. To come so far and not stay here would be a shame, even for budget travelers. Everyone should stay here at least once."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Very good experience. Seamless check in and check out. Prompt and adequate service.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We were upgraded from the city view to the view of India Gateway- THE BEST. We checked in really late at midnight and requested for late check out. Without a second thought, we were given a 4pm check out with no additional charge. The housekeeping service was superb  - sweet minor details everyday. I would stay again without a second thought."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Pleasant,comfortable,very friendly and efficient staff."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,My stay was wonderful. Right from my arrival when I was greeted with a garland of flowers it was a great experience. After 3 days of travel it was an oasis of luxury and relaxation.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,This was an excellent experience. Staying at the Taj is an experience you want to have again
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent. The staff was courteous and attentive. The room was comfortable and clean with a great view  Perhaps replace the shower curtains - a funny thing to see in a hotel of this standard. Your hotel is well located  - for me that is the most important aspect.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj hotel in Mumbai is something different! Probalby the most awesome hotel I have ever been in from all the houndreds around the globe. It give u a true feeling of being a colonial king! Staff is amazing and helpful. They offer any kind of help you need. Got a bit of food poisoning when i stayed there but it could have come from something else too. location is good too, you can take the boat to elephanta island just outside the hotel. Be prepared for a crowded place!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a lovely stay at the Taj Mahal palace. The location is perfect, the pool and restaurant are really nice, the staff very helpful and competent. 
The food is abviously a bit pricey, but worth it considering the quality and the environment. 
We were upgraded and had a room with a view on the Gate of India. Just perfect!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"It's my second time at this hotel , and the reason behind coming back to it is because of the great food that the hotel resturant provide as well as the building of the hotel it's very classical and amazing. Colaba Area is one of the famouse location of shopping in Mumbai that is the second reason. I am sure I am coming back again .."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Very, very good indeed. They have perfected hotel keeping into an art form all of their own."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I thorughly enjoyed my stay.  It was my first visit at The Taj Mahal Hotel.  I enjoyed teh elegance, the beauty, the style, the setting, the staff , the food. I can go on an on."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Totally amazing - looking forward to visting taj again very soon
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Amazing
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We loved staying here - from the moment we were picked up by the airport, we were treated with the utmost courtesy and thoughtfulness.  We are just ordinary travellers, who decided to treat ourselves to a special first three nights in India.  Nothing was too much trouble and we are very proud to have stayed at 'India's best hotel'!  A well deserved title."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fantastic stay! We stayed in the palace wing for 3 nights. If you do so make sure not to mix the lounge room with free coffee and tea and the cognac and chocolate hour every night. Also the hotel history tour (every day at 5/6) is an absolute must and will give you so much appreciation for the hotel. The breakfast is phenomenal and I'm still trying to figure out the smell of the hotel. It feels like you're home - only better!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,it was very nice stay
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Having spent two nights at the Taj, our stay was nothing short of pleasant. We encountered many staff members who were extremely hospitable. Mr. Mistry at Wasabi, Mr. Bhushan at the Sea Lounge, Mr. Moshin and Mr. Sunil by the pool and Ms. Ayesna (sp?) at the reception were very gracious and welcoming. 

There are a few short comings that are worth a mention.

1) No Wi-Fi without paying extra. There is absolutely no excuse for this. In today's world that's like saying you have to pay for the use of electricity and water while you stay at the hotel. I have stayed at multiple hotels around the world and many 2 and 3 star hotels provide free wifi to their guests. It's not about the cost it just makes you feel less guest-like when you are asked to pay for it. 
2) I noticed a lack of attention to certain details. For example the wine bottle in the mini bar was priced at Rs. 1800 but there was a sticker in the back that said the retail price was Rs. 1200. That's just shoddy presentation.
3) Although friendly overall, I felt like the security staff at the front could do a little more to welcome guests. It is true that their job is very serious but sometimes a smile or a nod can go a long way. Maybe the hotel could have a greeter  just past the security guards at the entrance to make the guests feel more welcome? This is after all the first contact that a guest has with the hotel's staff. 

Overall we were very pleased with our stay. I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to experience some of the best that Mumbai has to offer. The Taj Mahal Palace stands neck in neck with the top hotels of the world when it comes to hospitality."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Very good
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,My stay at Taj has been a lifetime experience. I was there to celebrate my birthday and the staff made sure that my special day turns out to be great. Thank you so much for the awesome hospitality.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Very nice
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fantasic. Taj is a fantastic hotel, in the best location. Dont be afraid to take a walk and visit all the cool design shops around the neighborhood like The Good Earth, Bungalow 8, and Bombay Electric. Lots of hecklers and beggars around (Unusual for rest of Mumbai), but I wouldnt worry about it. Politely decline and move on . Pool is nice. Great place to relax."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"One of my favourite hotel experiences! Staff were lovely, helpful, and went beyond to make my stay cushy and comfortable. I came back tired from work one day and the service staff had set up a complimentary foot soak and face mask for me to unwind with- it's these small touches that stood out to me most. Room was beautiful, felt quite plush, and very functional. This is a historical hotel with beautiful ornate furnishings and a fantastic view of the Gateway of India. Will definitely wish to return."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was perfectly beautiful and comfotable stay as usual.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Taji Hotel is very famous in India.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Service was awesome. Across the board. Spa, dining, concierge, staff, facilities. All excellent. Every single staff member, facility, view and service available is designed to be an experience you will not forget / talk about forever - and hold up as a benchmark for other hotels (that won't come close). This is the hotel that I want to bring my future partner/love back too... or if I need to impress business colleagues just as equally! You will not be disappointed. Upgrade to a water view, upgrade to a palace view.. all great.. if you can't - just experience the hotel in all in beauty - whatever room type - they will not treat you differently.... and remember to go outside... the Gateway of India is just outside your door!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Was here for a holiday, then needed to stay for business/work. Internet speed was AWESOME - not slow/no shaving/no limits! Staff were awesome. The attention to detail whether it was room service or laundry or concierge was brilliant. Airport transfers are of ease. I love this hotel - for what i paid per night the service was exceptional!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I've never ticker so many items in ""great things about this hotel"". The service is awesome (personalised). The staff are regular, attentive and knowledgable about you your interests, likes, issues - in a great way (not in a nosey way). The attention to detail and your experience - will make your stay amazing.! Take the tour!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Great stay, everything perfect. The only thing that could make it even better would be wifi included in room price."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,amazing and wonderful place and i advise my friends to stay at Taj

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Much better than expectation.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The staff was so attentive and as per my request the room was upgraded (as it was available) and was given sea view room.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Sensational. Thank you
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"the service and staff performance is excellent. they are very friendly and attentive with my needs/request. the buffet breakfast also very good with good variety of indian, international and chinese food. the hotel is not just beautiful, but the location also centrally located on tourist area with good restaurants and attraction just walking distance."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I was with my family to spend a short holiday on insistance of my younger daughter who wanted to celebrate her last year in India before she moves out. We were in two adjecent rooms but as soon the staff came to know about my daughter she was treated for 4 days really like little Princess. Taj is a presitigious hotel in India and is the ultimate luxury one can experience. The rich heritage, colorful history and it's location is superb. The restaurants in the hotel are competing with each other but the hotels nearby are no less. We loved being at Leopod and LPQ just walking distance. If you wish to soak yourself with high class luxury ever, never miss Taj at Mumbai Kolaba."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We stayed for 1 night and it was very great. I felt like a royal in my palace. :)
Security is very tight which is a good thing. I would definitely love to come back and stay here when I am in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was nice to stay in the hotel. The staffs were friendly and accommodating. It have an easy access to the public transport and located at the heart of the city.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Truly one of the world's finest hotels, though you do pay for it.  Room in tower had spectacular view of harbor and Gateway of India.  Room wasn't as large or modern as similar hotels, but furnishing were top-notch and service was impeccable.  Dining was excellent -- be sure to enjoy afternoon tea in the Sea Lounge, lunch by the pool, and the signature drink in the Harbour Bar.  Don't waste your time with hotel tour, which was only an advertisement for hotel's shops and restaurants and light on the history."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,wonderfull
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,A nice thing to do.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,My stay at the Taj - as locals call it - was an unforgettable experience.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I was at Taj with my wife and Teenage daughter for vacation and we could not had it better. Right from the arrival till our stay we felt pampered. Taking care of our individual choices in breakfast and remembering  it for all four days of our stay touched us. My daughter was truly treated very special and was showered with every day surprise gift in her room including a cute bunny toy on day one (she is old enough for bunnies but she loved the attention). The daily morning tour of Hotel Taj is a memorable activity which must never be missed. You get to know very interesting historical facts about the hotel, Mumbai and Tatas (who built this hotel). Proximity to some wonderful restaurants in the vicinity is icing on the cake. The pool is fabulous and ever smiling staff is a treat to interact.
The rooms are not as big as you will find in some brand new luxury hotels but they are well kept, vintage look with all facilities. We were lucky enough to be booked into Palace part of the hotel (though we got the pool view as against sea view). If you are booking this for leisure be careful and check if your booked into Tower or the Palace. The tower (newly built part of the same hotel) is actually meant for business travelers."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. We were upgraded to a wonderful room in the palace wing with a fabulous view of the Gateway and sea. The evening tour of the hotel pointed out so many details we would have missed otherwise. There are beautiful flower arrangements throughout, very attentive and approachable staff. Attention to details made our stay above anything I have known before. Sunglasses left I the room would be joined by a glasses wipe. A book left on the table would have a bookmark left on it. Every time we returned to the room we were welcomed by such special touches. It was a privilege to stay here."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My stay at The Taj Mahal Palace was the single, best experience I have ever had in a hotel. I travel frequently to all sorts of places around the world, but my experience at The Taj Mahal Palace was phenomenal. I was delighted with the service, attitude and level of attention from the staff, and the property itself is purely majestic. To walk through the hotel is to feel like a king, and I would thoroughly recommend anyone to stay at this property as and when they have an opportunity. This is one of the last remaining places I have seen where you can experience the great tradition of Indian hospitality that has been such a feature for centuries in India. Great hotel, great staff, great stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Our 3 night stay at the Taj made our visit to Bombay one of the most enjoyable trips.Have been to Bombay various times but this was the first time at the Taj and would definitely stay at the Taj during our future visits.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Great stay!  Amazing hotel that will truly give you a luxury Mumbai experience.  Service, room, breakfast all 5 star.  Only complaint - free wifi only in business centre and only for 30 mins - cheesy for this calibre of hotel."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,its very comfortable ..value of money..love to visit again my family was happy specially my 6yr old son loved it
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,very nice hotel. Although its a business hotel but we used it for leisure travel and the hotel format is such that it was very enjoyable for us.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Very comfortable and relaxing stay, Staff sere friendly and helpful.  Hotel of this grade and charges for internet service is very surprising."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was nice and relaxing stay.  Staff were very supportive and friendly.  However I was surprised to see that wireless internet was not free and there was no WC shower.  These facilities are now available in almost all hotels.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Great stay - the service was second to none. Everything worked very efficiently. We got upgraded to the old palace wing which really made or stay great. The breakfast was delicious!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We loved this hotel. It is of the highest quality and represents good value for money despite the higher rates.
Food is available in a range of restaurants and a range of menus.
The pool feels like a tropical island with palm trees around a large pool.
We would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Mumbai. It was great."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Stay was great. After spending a few weeks in cheap guesthouses it was a nice change for a few nights. Comfy bed, hot shower, in room safe and across the road from the Gateway of India. Good cheap food not far away and top notch security."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Lovely Indian service, warm welcome (with flowers) and a drink.  Stayed in the Palace Wing (highly recommend as this section has been renovated) with a room overlooking the Gateway to India.  Wonderful service, attention to detail in the room (from thoughtful small gifts to the staff inserting a Taj Palace bookmark in my book where they saw I had turned down a page corner).  Rooms and baths are well appointed and the property is beautifully maintained, clean and comfortable.  Beds were perfect.  I can't say a negative thing about this property."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I enjoyed my stay at Taj Mahal hotel
The service was very good
The staff was very welcoming and nice
Clean Room clean bathroom as well 
The room service was fast and The food was Delicious.

The only two things i didn't love about the hotel was the 3G conection was so bad , and the maids was asking too much about the Cleaning and if im ok with their cleaning !
Whats so annoying about it that they ask more than 3/2 times A DAY
They even call from the reception if you tried to ignore a little but just to ask you if everything was ok 
Personally i dont like to keep answering the door or the phone more than once when i try to Relax 
Specially when its about the same question !"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We have stayed at the Palace section before and we got much better service there than staying at the a tower section. Breakfast and the service at breakfast was not very good.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My stay in the hotel gave mix feelings, while the service was nothing to complaint, the food was amazing in Japanese and Indian restaurants even the bakery. The tea served here was also great. But there are some problem of sound proof, I stay on 6th floor but still can hear car horn sound from the city below, which sometime so loud that disturb my sleeping, quite dissapointing on this matter."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I travel extensively for work and pleasure, and I can safely say that this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff literally bend over backwards to accommodate any request, and the building itself has a beautiful and fascinating history. Ask for a sea view room overlooking India Gate - worth the premium price."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The stay was very pleasant.  We will stay again at the Taj when we visit Mumbai in future.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Recommend because of history and location.  Concierge most helpful.  Atmosphere cold with no welcoming touches in room.  Not happy to be given a smoking room and staff made little effort to relocate us.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had originally booked in the tower section of the hotel. The rooms were average, nothing great. We requested to be moved to The Palace. Despite the increased charge, the upgrade was amazing. The rooms were large, beautiful and extremely clean. The attention to detail could be seen in the smallest things. The service was unbelievable with cleaning staff leaving beautiful messages on our pillows, placing bookmarks in our books and going extra lengths to make our stay comfortable."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We spent a month in India at less expensive hotels but for the one night we stayed here we were treated like royalty (despite clearly not being!) and enjoyed the luxury. Breakfast was included, a buffet of international range and quite easily one of the best we've ever had anywhere! Everything else at taj is extra tho (e.g. WiFi was 700 rupee/hr) and bar prices matched london."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"It was not worth the money, not in the chaos of Xmas, like stepping into a shopping mall full of tourists when alighting the lift. No internet room is crazy in this level of luxury. Food very ordinary...2restaurants booked out could only have Xmas lunch round the pool!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"nice quiet surroundings, in room router for wifi although you pay for internet, staff very helpful, great buffet breakfast. wouldn't change much."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My stay here was far too short!  I was in Mumbai for business and really didn't get to see much of the city.  The best part of my stay was the view from the room.  I looked out onto Gateway to India and it was so beautiful to see at sunrise!  The weather in Mumbai was amazing.  Warm, sunny, not too cold at night.  People were out on the streets until midnight, just enjoying the weather.  The breakfast was quite good and I enjoyed eating out by the pool area.  The wifi is great in the hotel and can be accessed from all areas of the hotel.  Unfortunately, they do charge about US$20/day for wifi.  Would be better if it were free! I would stay here again."

A little too busy the front and lobby, give the recent past experience but safety of the hotelier taken care off...
Very glad I stayed here"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Absolutely amazing hotel!
Best trained staff in the world!
The hotel made you want to stay longer and longer as the staff truly make you feel so special!
Gorgeous on both sides - the heritage club side and the lesser expensive tower side - stayed in both !
The only thing I didn't like is that thei wifi is charged extra - which for such a high end hotel should be complimentary and that it kicks you off the network and you have to constantly log in again- which is a royal pain.."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"goood but not recommended for Arabs people because non of the 80 channels in the hotel TV is Arabic, so Arabs will feel bored in the rooms"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It has good location to visit and has history hotel. Service in the hotel is very good and make me feel comfortable. It deserved to visit again.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fabulous stay with great service from all in the hotel! The only tiny complaint I have will be the tiny shower cap that could not fit any adult! 
Great restaurants by foot include Indigo, Leopold and the hotel Italian and Chinese restaurants!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a great stay at the Taj. From the moment we entered, we were treated like royalty. From being garlanded and given some tea in reception to giving us a complimentary gift for staying with them. It truly is a beautiful hotel, very opulent. the breakfast is sooo good, very big variety. This is the hotel to stay in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Excellent stay, the staff are fantastic. Booking ongoing flights, advice on tours and attraction. Business application etc.  I can't fault anything about this hotel."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Cannot be faulted. Excellent on all levels. Golden dragon resturant is amazing.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We initially booked for the Basic superior room located in the Tower wing. Although they upgraded us to a Deluxe room in the Tower wing facing the Arabian Sea we were still very disappointed at the room size, ceiling height, bathroom size and the general atmosphere within. It was by no way 5 star standards given the high price we booked at. We called the reception and complained. They offered to show us rooms in the Palace Wing. Believe me when I say this, one was heaven and the other was hell. Significant difference and much to our liking. Unfortunately we had to pay extra which blew up our budget for the trip but I think it was worth it. They did upgrade us to the Taj Club which had more facilities and privileges attached. If anyone is traveling to Taj Mahal, you need to book in the Palace Wing. Otherwise choose some other 5 star hotels. Overall the staff were friendly and attentive. And they gave us a lot of pleasant surprises in our room every night. Very personal touch. As we were celebrating our 3rd year wedding anniversary they gave us a nice cake on arrival. Great service and personal attention to detail! Housekeeping did a fantastic job and making the room feel welcoming every time we step foot in it away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai life. Enjoyed the high tea, evening cocktails and 'chocolate n cognac'  which were a treat available free for Taj Club patrons."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I stayed at the Tower. You have a heritage wing of the hotel with Suites which looks luxurious but I cannot comment on that.
The Tower rooms were not very impressive. The decor looks dated and the room had an aged look to it. The food was nothing great with not a very big spread on breakfast. I have been at better business hotels in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fabulous. And extraordinary after service, when I left some belongings there that were forwarded to me."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Pool was really good. I wanna stay this hotel again.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"the Taj Mahal Palace is an institution and a proud part of Indian history. Of course this comes at a price. The tower rooms are as good as any other hotel of its category, but the position and the view - right opposite the gateway to India - and the elegance of the old part of the hotel give it an extra edge. You stay here for the experience as much as the facilities - and it is an experience!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Very comfortable stay in Old Wing room; beautiful ornate rooms; lovely pool setting; exemplary attentive, courteous and friendly service; undoubtedly one of Indias finest hotels."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Was there for a weekend trip. Really enjoyed our stay. It was my mom's b'day and the staff of Taj made the day very special for her!!! It is the best of all the Taj hotels that we have stayed in!!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. My friend and i are budget travellers, when we were going through Lonely Planet - India, we saw that this hotel was 'splurgeable'. 75% of our travel budget went to this hotel, but no regrets. WELL WORTH IT!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"What should i say... it is an extraordinary place to stay. We could afford only one night in the Taj buj it was worth it. We had the best breakfast of all hotels so far. The inner garden with the large swimming pool realy takes you back in history due to its apperence.

Great Hotel with a lot of History"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I happened to be a guest on my birthday. They had my whole room flooded with red heart shaped baloons, bed was decorated, a bouquet of flowers and a large chocolate cake. This was a real treat for someone travelling on business on birthday, away from family."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Only downside to this hotel is you had to pay  for wifi which in my experience comes  free in most hotels .Wifi is also very expensive.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"In a nutshell.....well worth it.....right accross from the Gateway of India, the hotel itself is a Heritage Site, no security concerns after the last attack, great and professional staff, clean rooms and a range of cuisine to choose from......"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fantastic hotel, room was large and extremly well furnished. The staff were polite and attentive. he facilities were in th hotel were very good business centre and the pool and gym facilites were very good.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Nice stay love the hotel
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The purpose of my visit was mainly shopping. 
I requested a double bed room, but was given a room with two single beds.  I requested a change an immediate change which I got. I was glad that I opted for a room with a double bed as it was slightly larger and more spacious.  The room was comfortable and clean, but not as luxurious as I had expected. The bed was rather uncomfortable - I expected a plush, soft mattress.  I have stayed in the Leela Kempinski near the airport a few times and in comparison, their rooms are a lot more luxurious and the beds are extremely comfortable.
The location of this hotel was excellent for my purpose of visit - shopping.  It was not too far a distance from the areas that I wanted to visit.  
The breakfast was decent.  Not an extensive variety but enough choices.  The staff at the restaurant were extremely attentive without being intrusive.  However, breakfast on Saturday was not a good experience at all - I requested for hash browns to go with my scrambled eggs which didn't arrive.  When I inquired I was told it had been forgotten!  When it finally did arrive it was under cooked; not the nice golden colour one would expect.  By this time I was fed up and was and had long finished my scrambled eggs.  however, the supervisor insisted on getting the perfectly golden hash browns, which i finally got!  my request for waffles was also forgotten - they weren't good anyway.
Pastries and cakes - not good.
Good variety of fruits. Dosa was delicious.  Highlight was the fresh honey with honeycomb - loved that!
All in all a  pleasant stay.  As this was my first stay in Taj group of hotels I was expecting a little more luxury!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,At a hotel like this I would expect free wifi. There are lots of taxis near the front of the hotel or you can arrange transport through the hotel. Great view of India Gate and and a great overall experience.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Staying at the Taj Mahal Palace was truly the most superb hotel experience I have ever had, and probably ever likely to have. The staff could not have been more attentive, but were never over-bearing. The pool and breakfast room were gorgeous, and I had the best night sleep I'd had in months. If you're travelling to Mumbai, the Taj Mahal is a must!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Great for a night, but not sure worth the money for an extended stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"When i arrived we were welcome by a welcome flower. The staff there is very helpful and they even escort you to the room and show you the surroundings. In the hotel you are surrounding with the aroma oil and it smells great! The staff is very helpful, they help us to become the translator when we call upon a taxi. It's a good stay and you will feel the different India especially when you look out from the room window. The gateway of India just in front of you! It looked beautiful when sunrise and sunset!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This luxery hotel was surely that.  The staff could not do enough for you, running back to add breakfast items, negotiating taxi service, or simply saying hello with a smilt.  The Taj is a great place, after a site seeing blitz, to take some time off.  Try the high tea in the Sea Lounge you will not be disappointed.  The only weak point is paying for internet access, that needs to change."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Stands up to its reputation as an excellent hotel.Those who are in doubt, try a breakfast around the pool area."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"An oasis in the middle of chaos.  The Taj Mahal Palace is so iconic of India.  We live in India and staying here was just something we needed to do.  While staying in the new tower isn't as exciting as the classic part of the hotel, it is a great deal on the weekends.  You still get access to the beautiful pool and fantastic restaurants.  Service is top-notch.  Oh, and be sure to check out high tea.  It's amazing and you won't need much for dinner after that.  Get there early to get a booth on the window to look out at the water and India Gate.  You'll feel like the king and queen of the town watching the world go by."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was a great place. Location superb as it is near the beach and also near the shopping centres. Service was also good. Over all this hotel is good. The business centre also good. The staff are friendly.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Everything from the rooms to the staff to the breakfast, the gym, the swimmingpool is completely amazing! I have never been to a more positive and great hotel! Wow!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Highly professional yet friendly service by very personable staff make the ""Taj experience"" all that one hopes for in a legendary hotel.  The details that combine to make this a smooth, pleasant experience include courtesy, clear communication, under-lights in bathroom for easy access in the dark, quality towels and toiletries, quiet, fast elevators and carpeted corridors.
Bed linen was crisp yet dreamy soft, the good desk had a view of the Arabian Sea."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"originally booked a tower room, but upon arrival we were given an upgrade to the palace wing. room was amazing: marble bathroom, comfortable bed with many pillow options, beautiful and calming decor. it was a total paradise and welcome escape from the overwhelming atmosphere that one can be confronted with in india. buffet breakfast was nice. you can also get beef at the restaurants... so spaghetti bolognese was a welcome luxury after 2 weeks of classic indian food."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We stayed in the club rooms in the old part of the hotel. Hotel is absolutely beautiful. Pool area was great to relax. Service was impeccable and the location was great, in the best area of Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,End of a hard month of traveling perfect end of the stay. Worth every penny
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"it is one of the horrible hotel  of taj brand in india...stinking actors the hotel due to horse , non maintained room with half of amenities not working, uncleared floors...
most importantly very poor internet services.. rude and arrogant behavior of restaurant during breakfast and dinner.. and very ordinary quality of food....

overall, waste of money to stay with taj mahal hotel, 

people stay because of its location"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"this will be my only choice to stay for all my future trips to mumbai. the service is fantastic, the standards exceptionally high and the food excellent. this is a must experience for all who can or who can not (like us) afford it."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj Mahal Palace offered very good personel service. The room service is perfect, at times a bit slow. The restaurant services are excellent. The morning breakfast buffet is a wonderful combination of Indian and Western Continental style food.
The tropical garden near the pool is nice. At times the black crows try to pick on the food if your not awear."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,it was so awesome being part of one of india's oldest heritage with excellent class service n hospitality

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The building and rooms are beautiful, like a Palace. Thus the place needs to be renovated. No modern shower, only a bath tub with a shower. The pool area is very loud. The food in the Pool side restaurant poor. The breakfast is a threat for your figure, you get everything you like - they offer a huge variety. The Spa is nice, I had a great massage. Gym is ok, friendly personal trainers are available.
Service is great!"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I came down with a terrible stomach bug my first day in Mumbai and the hotel not only looked after my physical health with a superb doctor and immediate delivery of necessary medicine, they also lifted my spirits with small gestures of kindness.  At every instance the staff showed genuine concern that my stay be as pleasant as possible which was especially notable 
as I was confined, due to illness, to the hotel for an entire week.  I can not say enough wonderful things about the depth of dedication to their guests each and every member of the staff projects.   This is the ultimate in 5 star service with a genuine smile.  Thank you to all the gracious people who took such good care of me and to the owners who are clearly dedicated to making the experience of each guest a complete delight."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is amazing comparing to your other generic 5 star hotels.  They offered us a late check out until 3 or a half day rate until 9 pm if you those late flight.  The pool, sauna, steam room and gym were also free to use.  The location is perfect as you can see the gate way to india from your room and walk to the boat the elephant island.  The only gripe is you have to pay for Wifi but thats pretty much the same for other in class."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we absolutely loved every minute of our stay at the taj.  all the workers were incredibly helpful and pleasant, especially roop who did the hotel tour and glen at the concierge desk.  everyone did their absolute best to accommodate you and make sure you had a pleasant stay.  we originally had booked a tower room (we didn't realize at the time of booking), when we had shown up to check in they gave us a free upgrade.  this kind of thing never happens to my wife and i, so we were perplexed, but incredibly excited.  needless to say, i recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again in the future."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"since it was not the first time that i was a guest in the taj mahal hotel mumbai, i new, what i am going to expect. it is so far the best hotel i have visited ever. ther is realy nothing to complain. the only thing maybe is, that the spa area should get renovated."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We stayed in the tower and had great views over the Gateway, people to one side and the boats to the other. The service was exceptional. The room was okay, nothing fantastic. I'd expect more for just shy of 200GBP. Dinner at the Masala Kraft restaurant was nice, but overpriced. The swimming pool and spa are lovely."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is the first hotel we've ever stayed in where the hotel experience was the highlight of the whole of our time in a city - Mumbai is hard work, but the Taj makes it very bearable. From the moment that reception uttered those words that every travellor hopes for, ""we have upgraded you sir"", we felt like kings. The ambience of the Palace wing (completely refurbished after the 2008 terrorist attack), the exemplary service, the complimentary cocktails and the cognac and chocolate nightcap made the stay here a highlight of 5 weeks in India. Splurge if you can - it's worth every penny."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"made my 2 year infant feel so special

* Incredible vista of waterfront and Gateway
* Amazing hospitality from check-in staff at arrival (great ideas like flight check-in)

* Free guided walks of hotel and area (very interesting).
* Great breakfast. Wasabi restaurant can be missed - terrible value for money and you would expect better service/decor/quality."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I transferred to the Raj hotel from another 5 star Mumbai hotel following a recommendation from one of my suppliers.

Probably the best decision of my trip to Mumbai.

The one and only criticism I have is that the bathrooms in the Tower rooms are somewhat dated and lack a separate shower."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Very efficient staff who do everything possible to make their guests comfortable.

Being extremely critical the only negative point is that the rooms  in the Tower Wing are quite small for a hotel of this calibre and, space permitting, it would be good to have a separate shower cubicle."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Definitely lived up to the famous hotel that it is, stunning location overlooking the gate of India, you will not be disappointed by staying here, we loved every minute of our stay."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is the best hotel we have ever stayed at anywhere in the World. Words cannot describe the opulence,charm and depth of this incredible establishment. It is very clear that absolute passion is what drives every single employee here, many of which have worked here for 15 years or more. The service and room and hotel appointments in general are astonishing. It's eye opening and breattaking from the minute you enter the building. What can I say....take me there again now!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Upon arrival we received an upgrade to the Palace section & were guided to that reception area. Check-in was done in a second without the usual delays & filling out forms & the bags brought up instantly. We were welcomed in the traditional manner. 

The hotel is an oasis of quiet luxury in the hot & noisy maelstrom that is Bombay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This was by far the best hotel that we have ever stayed at. THe service was outstandig and the attention to detail was really amazing. On our first morning, when the newspaper was delivered to the room, the front page of the Syndey MOrning Herald was also delivered (to keep us in touch with news back home). Concierge services were excellent- nothing was too hard, or to difficult! Shops in the lobby were great as well. THe view from the room was perfect and the bed was so comfortable, but the breakfast in the Sea Lounge was the best part- the best tea I have ever had with the absolute best service!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we chose to stay in this hotel because:
- my indian friends said it's the hotel in mumbai
- it was featured in mi4 (note that the movie only showcased the ballroom and the suite floor... when u stay in this hotel, will u be going to the ballroom or the suite floor?)

why i won't stay in this hotel again:
- the staff is always hungry for tips. i'm not sure if it's because tom cruise tipped all the staff $ bills each or it's just the general attitude in mumbai... my friend and i was carrying 2 small luggage, a staff offered to bring them up to our room and we didn't have small change to tip him so we smiled ""thank you."" he just stayed there waiting... staring at us with an odd grin. we said ""thank you"" again but he dind't leave. so we ended up giving him $5-> my indian friend said a tip of $1-2 is the norm for hotel staff... and this happened again to us when we were leaving the hotel. 
- the front desk is unfriendly and a little unprofessional. we requested for room on higher floor, quieter, facing the ocean. she didn't even tell us what room she gave us and smiled ""here's you key, your room is ready."" when we went up we realized, she gave us room on 4th floor, facing the main town, which is full of honking noise until 1am... we were too tired to argue as we checkin in at 1030pm.

why we might return to this hotel:
- best location in mumbai... unless there'll be a new hotel built in the area soon! i hope this happens! plenty of amazing restaurants walkable from the hotel... and it's relatively safe because there is a college nearby~"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"i spent a couple of days in the taj mahal palace. it was excellent. if you would like to be treated as a real guest, spend some nights in this hotel. you will enjoy everything, from the rooms, the breakfast, the pool and the luxury stores and service!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,A beautiful hotel which takes you back to feeling like you are living in the 1920's. The highlights were the breakfast and the hightea. Situated in a perfect position for endless shopping with markets and brand stores stretched all around the area. Will definitely stay again if I'm ever back in Mumbai. The buffet breakfast was Plentiful and great quality.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I stayed here just two days,  but it was an unforgettable experience.   The hotel staff are extremely helpful and always trying to address the needs of the customer. 

I had a room overlooking the India Gate which was a rewarding experience.   

The hotel also several wonderful restaurants including international,  Indian, and Chinese cuisines.   All of them were magnificent.  

The Spa was best I have ever experienced in India."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Stunning grand hotel in the heart of the Colaba area, within 5 minuntes walking distance to great shopping and eating district. Best breakfast, with 5 star service.

Rooms in the tower building felt a little dated and in need of an upgrade.

Overall experience was fantastic and highly reccommened for couples, or even families with young children."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"checked in here for three nights after a horrid stay at the midland hotel.  
it has a provenance that makes it dear to the indian people and others around the 
world.    speaking to other guests, it was a reason they also chose this hotel.
the breakfast is delicious and you can have it around the pool which is beautiful and heated.
the room was very comfortable with a step out balcony.  make sure you take the free
five o'clock evening tour."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"After a couple of months of travelling in India staying at places from we decided to stay at the Taj. The guidebooks seemed to be down on Mumbai and hotels at about and below had very mixed reviews...it was my wife's birthday too so we decided to splurge. It was wonderful: spotless, comfortable, and gracious staff -- even to a couple of old hippies who had been washing their clothes in hotel sinks for weeks."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our stay here was excellent from start to finish.  We were treated like royalty, enjoyed the absolute most comfortable bed in a beautiful room with a stunning view, swam in a gorgeous pool, and ate delicious food at the restaurant.  The location of the hotel couldn't be better, allowing us to walk to interesting shops, sights, and restaurants.  Our questions were answered promptly and with attention to detail.  I haven't a single negative point about this hotel.  Worth every penny!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,there was a problem with our hotel driver and we have ended up waiting over an hour at an empty airport (late night) before someone finally turned up.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Although its the Taj Mahal, there is a difference between being a guest in the 'Palace' and the 'Towers'.... Its supposed to be international standard, but its a bit grubby. The staff are good, friendly and efficient."

There are various activities -  there is a boat trip every day at 5pm to see great sunsets by chinese fishing nets, traditional indian dance and great ayurvedic spa treatments.
The staff go out of their way to help.
As with most Indian hotels the wine is really expensive and Indian wine not always very good. Sula is the best if you want to try it."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"upon arrival service was second to none. offered incredibly early check-in and very late check out. checked things like air miles cards to ensure i could claim points. 
upgraded to superior room, although i must admit a real disapointment. stayed in the tower rooms, the room was standard 5 star affair and not something to remember, no seperate shower - very small space. felt old and certainly will consider paying a lot more for the palace rooms. outside the room the hotel was an incredible experience. excellent service throughout, the pool area was beautiful and peaceful. breakfast was ok. looking forward to taking a palace room next time."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we had some initial trepidation about staying at the taj mahal palace after the incident in 2008.  however, the charm of the place and the fantastic service at all levels of the hotel just won us over the moment we checked in.  there are also abundant f&b choices in and around the hotel.  being sited next to the historical gateway to india puts us close to the hustle abd bustle of the city but yet we are safely ensconced in the peace and quiet of the hotel."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we enjoyed our stay very much at this grand hotel. early check-in and late check and we made the most out of our time here, including a dip in the pool."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"i am myself the owner of a luxury small hotel and i must admit that travelling around the world in many palaces , i never had such a luxury experience

out of the fact that this historical hotel himself and the location , the service and the kindness and efficiency of the staff is a lesson to take for any person working in this industry.

close to perfection 

i will return and will keep the best remember of this experience in such a beautiful palace"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This building stands out in Apollo Bandar, a massive palace on the waterfront. The service was exceptional except for one very annoying point: when I checked in for my two night stay, I asked to have a late check out on the last day. The concierge said somebody would call me about it. No call the first day. The second day I rang the front desk and asked again. They said I'd get a call, again no call. The day of my checkout I called to ask, they said they'd get back to me. They rang back - half an hour before check out time, to say it would not be possible! Very inconvenient that they did not let me know earlier. Other than that, great place to stay!

Wait, one more thing - the mediterranean rooftop restaurant is terrible. Vastly overpriced and average food - although I had just been in Beirut... try some of the restaurants in the apollo bandar area instead, many great ones to choose from"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"everything totally 5 star, up to snuff; nothing lacking, usa/european prices...everything. an experience of the old raj india, not the current india...but a unique out of the past stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"housed in a 1903 building with a modern tower extension, our room was a mix of old-world charm andv indian elegance. the public areas reflect moorish, oriental, indian and florentine influences with vaulted ceilings, hand-woven carpets and crystal chandeliers.

there's a pool and fantastic spa and if you stay in one of the suites you get breakfast, happy hour cocktails and a bed time brandy for free.
¬†
the x-factor is that there are eight restaurants serving a wide range of cuisines, including eastern mediterranean at the rooftop souk and japanese at wasabi by morimoto."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,i just regret being so shortly in the hotel. the view from the rooms over the bay is wonderful. personal very friendly and helpful all the time. by the price of a breakfast you can eat a wonderful dinner at the restaurants surrounding the hotel.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we were upgraded to the palace tower. the hotel had so much character and so rich in culture with the art pieces generously displayed along the hallways. it is really living in a palace! 
check in was done by the duty manager while we waited in a private lounge.
the lobby of the tower was exclusive and had a beautiful fresh flower arrangement. 
a lifetiime experience!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Staff treated us like Royality and were extremely helpful and caring. My wife was sick for the evening and we ordered room service. The waiter went beyond the call of duty and made herbal medicine to cure her cold. The restuarant staff and breakfast staff guided us in the selection of the cuisines we wished to eat which we thoroughly enjoyed. The porters and travel desk were very helpful and the hotel even discounted some of the items on my bill, to my surprise. Excellent choice to stay at the hotel to experience the Taj Royalty, I will most definitely go back to the Taj

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,a great hotel with lots of past history.service at its best.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"this is a world class hotel and everything lives up to that standard. when things went wrong (our new year's car was ordered for 2013 not 2012) they compensated us immediately and went out of their way to make our stay even more memorable.

all the food they served was 1st class and the service knowleagable and attentive"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Taj mahal is one of finest and oldes hotel in mumbai it before freedom
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Arrived very early, but our rooms were available. Not only that, the hotel upgraded us to their Palace Rooms. Which included free drinks at certain times. We were so well looked after by the ever present and helpful staff. A weekend to remember. Would highly recommend for any special occasion."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,i was only able to stay for one night but i was very impressed by  the service. i enjoyed the use of the spa and the pool as well as the bar and restaurant areas. every member of staff was welcoming and helpful. a fantastic stay
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,we had stayed at the taj mahal palace for 3 nights and was well worth every penny spent. it was a wonderful experience and we have not one flawed memory of the entire stay there. from the onset of our interaction with staff they were always pleasant and attentive. the attention to detail and service were impeccable. the decor is luxurious and tasteful. it was the perfect place to end our holiday in india.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"this historic place is just a great place to stay. it is centrally located and you get the comfort you expect im india for a 5 star hotel. it is important to know that the palace and the tower is connected and room categories are different. the palace, as the name suggests, is better to stay with. the rooms in the tower are good, and with carpet rather a bit smelly. nevertheless the common area is shared and is just a gorgeous fairy-tale blend of islamic and renaissance styles."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"whether you are passing through or staying a while, this is a great hotel. if you go to mumbai and have not visited the taj tower and palace, you have short changed yourself.
you have a choice; the tower is cheaper and the palace is superb, but both worth staying at."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This time we stay in the tower side, but actualy the palace side should be the heritage part, thats a little bit not in our expectation. but the room is great and serveice as well."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"the superior rooms in the tower section are very value. you have access to almost all of the same top quality facilities as those staying in the palace. the gateway of india and colaba causeway is just outside. if you like shopping close at hand, this is ideal, plus loads of excellent restaurants."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The rooms are very large, clean and well-equipped.  The high ceilings are very nice.  The bathtub is also one of the larger ones I've seen.  Although the building has never been a 'palace', you can imagine exactly how living in one would be like.  

The service is also remarkable.  The service staff seem genuinely eager to help you with any and all request, none to small.  They even offered to help my pack my bags the night before i checked out! The pride within each employee of the Taj is very obvious and this comes shining through with their impeccable service."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The Taj Hotel is a very nice hotel however the rooms are starting to become quite dated and very old style looking a bit tired. The internet was a good connection however they charge per device unlike most other hotels. The restaraunts were very expensive and food quality was not that great. bar food was particularly expensive as was the simple buffet despite much better offerings for lower prices at other Indian hotels. Car hire was also very expensive compared to other hotels. TV was very old and did not work properly despite asking for it to be fixed.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Pleasant.  Room with nice view. Staff very eager to please and helpful.  Nicely decorated public areas.  Breakfast very nice and pleasant atmosphere all round. Location good for downtown (MG road etc.)
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Pros:
- Courteous and helpful staff
- Great restaurants (try Wasabi!)
- High security
- Beautiful hotel surroundings (the pool area is a nice place to sit back and relax)
- Excellent breakfast

Cons:
- Was really disappointed with the television in the room. It looked like it was from the 1980s! I had been travelling in India for three weeks and had stayed in some hotels that cost a third of what the Taj Tower Wing cost and they had bigger flat screen televisions! Time for an upgrade Tata!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Excellent hotel with really great service.
Heritage palace wing with beautiful interiors.
Rooms all new but a but small for what you expect."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Complete mess at the hotel entrance.  No parking facilities. Rooms out dated, need renovation. Prices totaly over standart. Who is not on buisseness in Mumbai should avoid going to this city. Never again."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"nice hotel, very helpful staff, good value for money, I would recomment it and stay there again, perfect as a departure point for a mumbai sightseeing tour."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our family spent several days to celebrate a special occasion and were overwhelmed by special attention to detail to make our stay memorable - welcome surprises at every turn: wine, flowers, rose petals decorating our bed, cakes, cards and small gifts from staff.  Excellent breakfast buffet and high tea."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Superb as always. The more we stay hwere, the more we like it. So many excellent shops just around the corner."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Exclusive hotel and Nice place
Very comfortable hotel for business and holidays travel,
The hotel car for pick up us very good."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Wonderful 5* beautiful hotel. A palace in every sense of the word. I was upgraded from a tower room to a palace room which was a bonus. Checkin was a dream with special Indian welcome ceremony. I have never seen so much granite in the bathroom. Sadly I was a solo traveller but i'm sure we could have fitted 10 people in the huge and ornate shower room!
Downside - although I got a very good room rate with Agoda drink and food charges in the hotel are astronomical - 500 rupees for a cup of tea or coffee! I also felt very guilty being in such luxury when millions live in the poverty and squallor of the Mumbai slums!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Incredible hotel, loved the stay. very close to great market too and amazing view of the gate...."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This hotel is very peacefully, staff is very smilling (but not too much) and helpfull. Everything is perfect.I appreciate the swimmingpool, the gym, the restaurant and the kindness of the staff."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"check in was very professional. security measured were a bit of a nuincance. room was spacious and clean, a bit damp though.
staff were pleasant and helpful. location was convenient but over-rated. breakfast was very good and refreshing. gym was excellent. foyer was beautiful and comfortable. will revisit."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Bet location for tourist as Gateway of India is just opposite the hotel with ferry to Elephanta Caves. Also, street shop along Colaba Causeway is 2 block away behind the hotel.Breakfast with great choice of variety of food including Indian, western, etc. Value for money as I have a good rate booked through Agoda.com. Definetely come back or recommend to friends whenever visiting Mumbai again. The only set back is that the carpet inside my room was aged and need to replace
and room house keeping need to upgrade as the keeper has not done a good job during my stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"An ideal hotel to stay for tourist without budget limitation. A little expensive compare to US hotel with similar rating. Considering Mumbai hotel rate, its value for money for a 5* hotel. To maintain the high rating,the Management should considering changing the aged room carpet, improve house-keeping. Upkeep the high standard of restaurant service and quality of foods .Will stay in this hotel again and recommend to friends visiting Mumbai."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Es un hotel de lujo que merece la pena visitar. El servicio es excelente al igual que la limpieza pero las habitaciones son relativamente sencillas. El restaurante franc√©s es muy caro y !cuidado con los collares de flores de bienvenida! (alguno puede llevar incorporado un visitante en forma de gusano verde). El comedor para desayunar ten√≠a demasiado movimiento de gente, con una oferta poco variada.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"de tower is gebouwd in de jaren 70 en heeft nog een beetje deze uitstraling, badkamers zijn krap en hebben nog een douche gordijn. niet wat je verwacht voor deze prijs in een 5 sterren hotel. zwembad is lastig te bereiken, je moet door de lobby. personeel is echter zeer service gericht.

Tenha cuidado com os pre√ßos dos extras: o pequeno almo√ßo, se n√£o estiver inclu√≠do, pode custar algo como por pessoa e o room-service tem tamb√©m pre√ßos assustadores.

Kommer man med tidigt morgonflyg g√•r det p√• ca 40 min in till hotellet annars ca 1,20 min.

Bem√∂tandet med en v√§lkomstseremoni med blomband och f√§rgdutt i pannan var trevligt, sedan visar v√§rdinnan upp mot rummet och ber√§ttar under tiden om hotellets utbud.
Det finns flera restauranger och barer ( 6 tror jag ) har provat 3 av dom med h√∂sta betyg fr√•n mig, mycket god mat och super bra service.

Poolomr√•det √§r min favorit! Byt om nere p√• Jiiva spa, du f√•r ett sk√•p f√∂r kl√§der, finns √•ngbastu, torrbastu, duschar och relaxrum d√§r du kan drick gott te och bara njuta.
Uppe p√• Poolomr√•det hj√§lper the poolboy till att fixa solstol med handdukar och du f√•r vattenflaskor hela tiden, f√∂r det blir varmt d√§r!
N√§r man har solar klart och byter om s√• har dom en "" badbyxcentrifug"" s√• bara sk√∂lja badbyxorna och centrifugera s√• f√•r man med torra upp till rummet!

Och rummet: superiorrummet inneh√•ller en soffsittgrupp, skrivbord med olika tekniska anslutningar, en stor sk√∂n dubbels√§ng med kuddmeny, badrum med badkar och dusch, det finns champo, duschcreme mm mm.

Mumbai,Sahara Star Hotel,5 stars out of 5,This is a popular hotel with some good dining options. Located very close to domestic airport terminal in Mumbai. In general rooms were clean and had all basic amenities. Staff needs to check that all plug points are working as we charge multiple devices these days. The hotel lobby also needs some more seating/ sprucing up.

I was there for a business meeting and had every details in my mobile of my clients. From you entrance security guards to your reception staff everyone was very helpful in every way. You really have the best team.¬†

Ms Sugandh and another staff from the reception i didn't get her name was very comforting and handle the situation so well and she recommended us to Mr Bhushan and was keep telling us he will try to help us find the phone.

Mr Bhushan went very far to find our mobile phone and made things so easy for us and he was well knowledge men and helpful men. We being not local and a tourist and not knowing anyone in the city it was very helpful of Bhushan and he and your team surely deserve the best appreciation.¬†

I was so stressed and went to your 2nd¬†floor restaurant to have some food to make myself feel better. I meet this waiter I didn't get his name he made me feel so better by talking to me and telling me I will get the handphone back don't worry.

Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,"Two day visit early June. Good points: excellent staff and service,  clean and nice room. Restaurant is good, the food variety is good though not enormous, probably more veg options than nonveg. 

To improve: small niggles in the room: bed not precisely alligned, bathroom door difficult to lock, safe having software error, toilet shower having too much pressure, flush water leaking a little.
Overall a good experience!!"
Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,"Room is spacious.
But overall lot of improvements can be done.
Reception staff was not well versed with the checkin process. Initially they have given me in too floor, then due to room door lock issue changed to another floor.
In that room as usual TV was having issue - but the operator came and did the repair and made okay, they were good in work. Toilet also wash area water was not flowing fast, somewhere some block was there.

Bed was cozy, so sleep was good.
Once you are checked in calling for maintenance and waiting for the repair all these are frustrating, better give a well condition room on the first place."

Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,Novotel stays would always be perfect.  Nothing to complain of.  Novotel staff ensure every single aspect of hospitality is effectively practiced so the guests witness the 5-star experience.
Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,"I stayed on 1st April. The hotel is sparklingly clean and the staffs are super kind.
One glitch was in the food which was managed extremely well by the staffs.

Second stay was from 13th to 17th April.
Again, everything was smooth. But I believe there is a lack of communication between staffs. You need to fix that. I was supposed to get 20% on food and beverages but nothing like that was given even after said that we are allocated the 20% on every food we order from the restaurant. Neither a reimbursement was made. 
And again, there was a major glitch in the food which I don't want to mention.

A 5 star hotel cannot do such mistakes. It's horrible as we are paying a huge sum of money to stay there.

One thing was good that the restaurant in charge as well as the chef came personally to the room to apologize and they provided some desserts which we didn't take as we were not craving for free things but to get the high standards we paid for specially for the food.

Overall, the stay was excellent. I loved the cleanliness.
Some people have commented that they see slums nearby and people just keep staring at them. I will deny this. To me, seeing those slums (small houses) made me feel more humble. We are all humans. Having some compassion in the heart is always good for every kind of people.

I will definitely stay in the hotel next time provided the restaurant staff make sure they don't repeat such a horrible mistake 3rd time with us."

The rooms were spacious and had a big sofa to lie down. The water bottles were also good in quantity. I loved their bhindi masala subzi from their menu. It was delicious. They even allowed Zomato food and served especially in my room as I was not well. I will definitely visit again in December

Mumbai,Novotel Mumbai International Airport,5 stars out of 5,"It‚Äôs good for being a value for money property to stay at. However, I feel that there are much better properties available in the vicinity for just some extra amount of tariff. 
There was a mention of both smoking and non-smoking room at Agoda while booking, however, when I checked-in, I was told that there is no smoking room in this hotel and the designated smoking area was also shut because of rains. I wanted to decorate the room for a friend‚Äôs birthday, but the management caused a lot of difficulties initially as they told me ‚Äòoutside decor items aren‚Äôt allowed‚Äô. The room was extremely beautiful with pretty good room service though. 

My overall rating - 7/10"

Mumbai,The Retreat - Hotel & Convention Centre,5 stars out of 5,"The Retreat is a perfect staycation with family and friends. It has all the facilities one could ever want, for children and adults alike. The play area is fun along with many indoor games like table tennis, billiards, carom, foosball, air hockey etc. You can also indulge in some self- care with steam bath, spa, Jacuzzi to name a few. There is close access to the beach or can simple choose to sit on the property among trees, plenty of flower gardens and a widespread of green grass. As evening dawns you can enjoy a relaxing time at the pool side loungers and gaze at the stars. You will never get bored here. The rooms are clean, service is up to the mark, staff is friendly‚Ä¶ what more could one ask for? The food is excellent with a wide cuisine, prices are a little high, but worth it once in a while. The Retreat is an all in one perfect package for an amazing getaway."
Mumbai,The Retreat - Hotel & Convention Centre,5 stars out of 5,"Stay and booking prize through Agoda is good and value for money.  The facility and the staff are also very good and friendly. Good clean pool and well maintained garden and lawn. Overall the place is very good for the experience in the price. 

But my only complain is that the food is way overpriced. Its like they are trying to coverup for the discount we got for the room in their food.  I tried the buffet dinner and it cost upto appox 1650per person with tax. With that amout i would expect a huge variety and options but sadly they provided any one starter for non veg thats it. And that too the quality, varity and taste wasn‚Äôt anything exceptional. So it was a big let down on the cost of food prizes. To top it off one cup of tea cost 235 rs. 

So overall if you are okay with the food prices then its worth visiting.  But if you like me who is choosing this place cause your getting a good deal on the room then please make arrangements to eat else where or else you will end up paying the same amout for food as you did for the room."
Mumbai,The Retreat - Hotel & Convention Centre,5 stars out of 5,"The place is well maintained and the staff is super polite. The rooms are spacious and super comfortable. The bathrooms are good too and the bathtub was the highlight of the stay.

There are some issues for sure. The place is far and road sucks. The thing that miffed me the most was the charge for plates and cutlery. We every charged 150 bucks for a set of plates and cutlery, this is a rather underhanded way of restricting customers from getting their own food."
Mumbai,The Retreat - Hotel & Convention Centre,5 stars out of 5,"Overall the stay was quite good with amazing food, humble staff & location is good but uncomfortable to travel due to under-construction roads & chaotic traffic. I think the local government should look into this matter. 
Rooms are cozy & attractive amazing ambience with the washroom & wardrobe section which falls completely seperate from the bed area. 
POV: the breakfast should have been included with the stay package.
Washrooms flush was a bit annoying as it has to be continuously pressed for the water flow."
Mumbai,The Retreat - Hotel & Convention Centre,5 stars out of 5,"Amazing property with access to beach. Inground swimming pool with changing rooms and f&b services. Dedicated area for DJs and parties.

We were unpleasantly surprised and disappointed at the standard of the room & services , especially at a hotel like the Taj, which has a stellar reputation of unparalleled luxury! My guests room in the Tower section of the hotel had bedbugs! My friends who went back to a family member‚Äôs home in Bombay was getting her clothes washed when the maid noticed the bugs! They had to get everything in her luggage and the whole house, including the curtains, bedspreads & cushioning boiled, steamed and then laundered! Though age had spotted bugs along the paneling on the walls, she didn‚Äôt want to create a big deal till she got home and Mainly because she  didn‚Äôt think that they would have got into her luggage! To top everything everything off they can‚Äôt even make a decent milkshake by the poolside! Even after informing them  that they haven‚Äôt stirred it well and that the cocoa is all stuck to the bottom and that it all you get through the straw is cocoa, they didn‚Äôt attempt to redo it or to offer us another one and they made it exactly the same way the next day as well! I‚Äôm appalled that though we have informed them, nobody has gotten back to us!"

I was disappointed because swimming pool was out of service."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It is just amazing. It worth to stay here just for a day (as it is expensive) to have a taste of luxury.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I have enjoyed staying at this hotel in all respects whether in the service, reception, treatment, eating or cleaning  rooms, but the price of the rooms is very high and I recommend it to the owners of high budgets but the owners of low budgets do not recommend it because there are luxury hotels and cheaper than that...

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Taj Mahal is the best one in the area and My favourite for relaxation they have the best spa ever
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Well worth the experience. The hotel has a rich history and amazing architecture that has last the years. Service was top notch and staff were really attentive. Nothing to fault! There were different wings to the hotel and some parts were undergoing refurbishment with minimal disruption to guests. Our room faced the Gateway of India too hence we got to see the traffic and experience the bustle from our balcony. Food at the restaurants were great thus one didn't need to head out to try the various cuisines if you chose to. Loved the experience and stay. A recommend!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,I was very impressed with Taj. Staffs were nice. Hopefully I will return again and recommend to my friends.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj Mahal Palace is an impressive Grand Hotel, how you imagine it should be. Location, service, view, stuff - whatever you are talking about.
Only disadvantage are the prices in the restaurants - they are also grand. Especially if you compare it to the price level around. But overall a must in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The hotel was superb. Attention to detail was 100% and the staff were delightful. The buffet breakfast had something for every taste in the huge choice on offer. Pool area was very pretty. Also very high level of security around the hotel.

Could be more helpful with the facilities and services. Overall they were very nice but need more activities for small children and entertainment."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,very good
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The place is good, but didn't like the food , the pay more attention to "" How the dish look"" than  the taste of the dish"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Taj created a wonderful hiatus in time

We were cared for, looked after and pampered 

After meandering through 84 countries, all of which God created in their own individual beauty, it took Taj to show us a genuine patch of perfection

Thank you

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Lovely place, food and drink are grossly overpriced, clean & tidy, pleasant helpful staff.  But for upmarket hotels I think Raffles in Singapore just has the edge on it!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is steeped in history and magnificent, the location is brilliant, however the prices are exorbitant and the room was not cleaned properly from the last occupant.....there was toe nails on the floor."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Your staff were beyond excellent.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"From the moment you arrive there are warm welcomes and many unexpected extras. We were upgraded to the magnificent heritage palace wing and everything was catered for, even before you realised you needed something, it was there. Yes you do pay more for everything, but the service, surrounds and attention to detail are worth it for a special treat. Our only slight negative was the quality of food at the Golden Dragon, which claims to be a Sichuan restaurant, but falls a little short of the mark."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Luxury accommodation
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Beautiful hotel which 100  years of history. Professional well trained staff make the experience even better.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,If you want to experience something very special than visit this place. History goes along with an outstanding service and beautiful views. Take a room in the old part of the hotel which is more expensive but so much more unforgetable. If you have a chance get a room with view of the ocean and the gate of India. A great experience will wait for you!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Friendly, professional, comfortable; an excellent hotel - we will visit again"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Sumptuous rooms. The heritage tour was very interesting.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is a magnificent establishment, and I'm pleased my group decided to stay here for a night after having spent 2 weeks trekking through the Himalaya sleeping in tents! We were a bit embarrassed arriving with backpacks etc, but the staff were wonderful and we even received upgrades. My only disappointment was our stay was too short!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj Palace hotel is one of my best hotel experiences thus far.  From the moment I arrived I was made to feel special by the hotel staff.  My stay was during Diwali 2016 and the hotel as adorned is Diwali ornaments and decorations.  At the reception desk, Priyanka greeted me with a smile and was extremely helpful.  I had an early check-in and she upgraded my room.  Thanks Priyanka.  My room came with butler service and provided fresh fruits which I requested.  The rooms are spacious and well designed.    A staff member escorted me to my room and made sure all was just right.  The property is gorgeous and not far from many attractions and sightseeing i.e. India‚Äôs Gateway.   Overall, great staff, rooms, service, and location.  I really enjoyed my stay at the Taj Palace Hotel and look forward to my next stay when I‚Äôm back in Mumbai."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was so beautiful stay & wish we could stay longer.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our superior king city view room was in the palace wing of the Taj. The charm of the palace wing is unmatchable. The team did up our room with lovely decor & filled with balloons since its our wedding anniversary. We even celebrated with a small size chocolate cake, compliments from the hotel. 

My wife had a pleasant surprise when the room attendant Keton & housekeeper Saksham left a pouch of indian accessories on the desk. She was delighted as its in time for our dinner at Souk. It matches her outfit too!

In particular, we enjoyed having breakfast at Shamiana instead of the Sea Lounge as Magalhaes was always there to brighten our mornings.  His service is commendable!

Taj is definately an experience you will remember and we are looking forward to coming back. Oh I almost forgot...u must join the daily tour of the hotel. Don't miss it."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Nothing here is a problem for management or staff. All performed beyond expectations and nothing was to much trouble. We received a most unexpected upgrade to a suite and when asked why, ""because we can"" was their response. The food and wine was varied and fairly priced. We ate at the Indian restaurant which was fantastic, excellent service. Breakfast buffet was outstanding.  Nothing was out of place and if you intend going to Udaipur this is a must. Beautiful. We will return and recommend it highly."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The room pictures and room were completely different. You had suite pictures for a normal room. The room service had the worst pasta I have eaten in my whole life. Disappointed as I am also an inner circle member of the last 6 years.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent facilities with high level of Staff hospitality
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,A special night to spoil ourselves

The evening tour was particularly interesting & informative.
Breakfast was sumptuous & service superb.
Every corner of the hotel exudes charm & grace.
The Taj is not somewhere to sleep, it's an experience.
Thank you."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We had the best time ever!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We really enjoyed our stay last weekend. Kids enjoyed it the most. Not a complaint but more of a feedback is that pool could be little more kids friendly (depth was a bit high). A game room or recreation room would have been great as well.

Loved it regardless!!!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent in all aspects!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Perfect
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Location of the hotel is just too beautiful and coupled with the impeccable service offered by the staff is just too good.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,I have travelled a lot and always stayed in a variety of Hotels but there is none to beat Taj Mahal Palace  Hotel in Gateway Mumbai.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,I cannot fault my experience at the Taj. The stay was amazing...
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is beautiful. Lots of heritage and character but modern finishes and comfort. We loved the pool, breakfast, all the restaurants were good and the location was perfect as a first time tourist in Mumbai.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fantastic
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj Mahal Palace is obviously THE place to stay in Mumbai but it lets itself down on a couple of minor points that shouldn't happen in a top class hotel.
The extras details in the bathroom were a bit basic and the safe was too small to take a small size laptop. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Lovely gardens and pool. Superb location."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent night
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our stay at the Taj was absolutely superb.  The staff are very polite,  friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good with a variety of food. The room was clean and very nice. We enjoyed our 2 nights at The Taj and look forward to staying there soon."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The only negative was the bad quality of wine and drinks. The internet was also very slow and we lost the connection all the time. The breakfast in the Sea Lounge was excellent!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fantastic

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It's a magic place.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Everything about our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace was superb. However, we were disappointed by the description of the view from the bedroom window!

We  booked a ""Deluxe Harbour View"" room but the only way we could actually see the 'harbour' was to put our faces up against the window and look to the right, at which point we were able to see a corner of it. Standing 'in' the centre of the room, the view was of a wall of the new Taj Mahal wall which stands in front of the 'old'. Had I known this was to be the case, I would have booked a different room.

Whoever wrote the view description had a very inventive mind!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Hotel most accommodating for our early arrival and a late departure. Take the free daily tour of the hotel to learn about the building and some history. Staff very helpful.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had requested a non-smoking room in the tower. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a suite in the Palace, however, we were not informed that it was a smoking suite. Not good if you have asthma. Other than that, we were satisfied."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"From booking in through to leaving all staff seemed exceptionally well organised, friendly and eager to please.   The stay at this hotel was a delightful and memorable experience."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is fantastic in every way. It's an impeccably well run hospitality oasis close to most major attractions in Mumbai, and great shopping.

The staff is professional, prompt and highly discreet. The food is excellent, as is room service. The gym, spa and hotel pool are well maintained - in particular the pool is an experience of its own.

I can't say enough about this hotel. As someone who travels about 150 days a year all over the world I can say with confidence that this is one of the very best hotels in the world."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was awesome
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Service, location, room, breakfast, atmosphere everything was excellent! I will be coming back!"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We encountered serious problems in the hot water pipeline wherein rusty water with metal chips kept coming the room till we had to call the technician. Certainly not expected with Taj. Rest of the experience is wonderful as you can expect it in this hotel....Will visit again but hopefully we'll have no troubles like this time....
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent hotel.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Near Perfect

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Beautiful, couldn't have stayed at a better hotel to round off my 30 days overseas. Staff were very competent and extremely polite and friendly.

Great experience all round."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a wonderful stay beginning with a very personal and efficient check in process, and continuing with superb service all through our time at the Taj. The ambiance of this hotel is truly unique. The location overviewing the Gateway of India is fantastic and a high level floor with view towards the water is definitely recommendable.
We enjoyed the Palace Lounge as a tranquil sophisticated retrait also very much.
All in all, the Taj is THE hotel in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is a beautiful example of colonial architecture.  I stayed in the old wing which was superb however a friend that I was traveling with was in the new wing and experienced multiple problems in the room such as AC, Windows, noise of construction etc.  staff service is generally of a very high standard however it is variable and inconsistent particularly around the pool area."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Unbelievably good stay
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I can say that during my visit to Mumbai,  staying at Taj mahal is my best experience.  Mumbai it self is not tourist friendly. 
The location very strategic,  the room very big and comfortable. 
Staff service is very good,  especially staff at restaurant while breakfast. 
This hotel also is a historical building, that's why for first timer in Mumbai, you must stay here. 

Unfortunately the restaurant inside is very expensive. We try the Japanese restaurant which cost usd 150 for 2 person for a little order only. 
Anyway, I would come back here again"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My son and I stayed for two nights and had an extremely enjoyable stay.  The staff are wonderful, the room perfect, pool lovely and breakfast delicious.  It's perfect, old-fashioned luxury with the added benefit of no-one trying to be too cool - just welcoming and helpful.  I will definitely stay again when we're next visiting."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"can't understand why no breakfast for booking a 5-star hotel, and the wifi speed sure as hell doesn't match the name of a 5-star"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Very comfortable and relaxing. We were greeted by all staff who we passed by either walking along the corridor, to the restaurants, shopping mall etc. This time it was 2 nights next time will stay a bit longer. Worth every penny,what a surprise upgrade to Taj Palace."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fantastic
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Outstanding hotel

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Made a reservation with Taj for pick up at the int  airport early morning at 5, worked wery smoothly, at 6 a clock il was walking in to the reception.
Had a room with city view. Comfy bed all product you need in the bathroom.

Il love the pool area. The pool man help you to at sun bed and provide you with thowels and bottle of water. If you need a locker room to change go down to the spa, there you allsow will find steam room and sauna.

TAJ  have several different restaurants and my favorite I Wasabi, next time I'll will only order dumplings, they are so tasty.

The breakfast buffe is lovely with everything you need.


Il be back in January 2016."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"From the moment the family walked through the entrance and were greeted by the staff we knew we had arrived somewhere special.  We were personally escorted to our rooms by Zeena, who looked after us superbly throughout our stay.  We were travelling with young children who were amazed to find their room decorated with balloons and gifts.  The rooms within the Palace were just a delight to be in as was the constant attention to detail from the turn down service to the beautiful rose petal designs left in the room after cleaning.  Its obvious that all the staff love working there and it really is an Indian Institution that all should sample.  We can not recommend this hotel enough."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I had a great time, the Heritage Trail was an eye opener"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We are business travelers decided to stay for three nights in Taj Mahal hotel and we make reservations via agoda but when we check out the one from reception stuff want to change me more than my bill which as we know for agoda police the price which shown in vouchers is the finel price

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is amazing, is an historical place in Mumbai in the heart of Colaba. The hotel is amazing and very luxury. 
Be careful one detail, this hotel have 2 buildings, old that is really crazy amazing and new that don‚Äôt have any novelty. Check to book a palace room as that part of the hotel is 100 + years old.
The service is very good, all staff are always happy. The only that I didn‚Äôt like too much was the breakfast, anyway is just a personal feeling, but is 5 stars anyway, and the internet cuts a lot, but the rest, this hotel is perfect. 100% recommended."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The service at this hotel is over the top. I have stayed at over a 100 hotels in 50 countries in the last 6 years and I would rank the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai as #1 in service, luxury, comfort, food quality and style.

Ohhhh my god it took almost 2 hours with reception manager it was wonderfull experience super time üëçüëçüëç"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"the stay was ok. Not what we expected from the Taj Mahal. The place was crowded, maybe because of new years' eve."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Wonderful, superb, They came to know that its our marriage anniversary and we were amazed by the gifts , cake, champagne, flowers. Not only this my kid was taken care also.. Dance class for him, then drawing book for him so that he enjoys his stay.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Great stay for those who want to be treated like royalty. Everything was great. My only reservation was that they were too attentive, we were asked if we needed anything about 10 times in a day. A little tiresome, but everything was great when we actually did need help with packing a parcel. They provided everything we needed. All in all, it was great, the room was nice, the breakfast was delicious, staff were very accomodating, the location was perfect for most tourist sites. Highly recommend this place. Thank you!"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I have been visiting india and particularly Mumbai for most of my years, generally on an annual basis and especially in the last 8 years each time visiting another city and returning to mumbai.
I have stayed in hostels in dongri, in bhendi bazaar and new bombai. Each time experiencing something new, but I know that now I will find it really difficult to stay anywhere else.
The Taj is more than a home away from home
Thank you from the bottom of my heart, but my purse does not feel the same"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"It's my third time in Taj Mahal Palace , and I got the chance to stay in the palace section this time with my wife , she really enjoyed her stay and asked me to take her back to it again. Mumbai is one of the cities that I really love and can't get enough of. The Staff is friendly and the breakfast is good. Taj Mahal Palace will be always my first choice whenever I am in Mumbai"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,A step back in time. One of the world's classic hotels.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fabuloud
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I cannot rate this hotel high enough. From a luxury point of view, it is amazing and the hotel is beautiful. But the service was just incredible and is what sets it above others. We arrived about 5.30am and we told we could pay a half board to have the room ready by 7am. This gave us time to have breakfast in quiet surroundings with a personal butler. To continue the great service we were upgraded to the Palace side which I would recommend paying more to stay in anyway. Each night we came back to our room to find personal gifts such as cake, silk scarves, Indian jewellery and one night 2 foot bathes were set up for my husband and I - the water was promptly delivered for us. Just what we needed after walking a lot in the heat. Relaxing in the pool each afternoon was also wonderful, and again the service by the pool staff was fantastic. Compared to other countries, the prices for accommodation and breakfast was very reasonable and so worth it.
In Mumbai, I would say go to Leopolds for beer and cheap curry, good fun and great taste. To upgrade a little, there is a local restaurant not far called Khyber - best Indian food we have ever had. 
With the help of a Dharavi local based tour company, Mystical Mumbai, we had an eye opening tour of the slum which we recommend. Make sure you check the taxi meters are on and you can rent a taxi for about 350 rupees an hour. Colabar Causeway is excellent for bartering for anything and the local shops along here, although generally fixed price, are still very cheap for well made Indian cotton clothing."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The service staff were friendly, attentive and went the extra miles to ensure I have a good stay in the hotel.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Truly magical stay!

Service was beyond compare and whilst expensive to stay represented superb value for money.
The ambience through the entire hotel was amazing.

We ate twice at the Masala Kraft restaurant and the food was simply fantastic, the Sketch menu was outstanding value as it was cooked fresh in front of you at your table and the Chef explained everything to do with the meal.

It is hard to put in to words how wonderful the staff were. From the front desk and check in to the house staff to the management...everyone was dedicated to ensuring a wonderful stay.

The Palace wing is steeped in atmosphere and ambience and was amazing.

As we were in the Taj Club section and were very lucky in that the hotel upgraded us to a suite we also had the high tea element, free cocktails, free cognac & chocolates and free tea and coffee throughout the stay in the Palace Lounge. A free transfer from the airport to the Taj was included as was breakfast.

The stay was not just a highlight of the trip but to be honest a lifetime highlight as well!

We simply can't recommend the Taj Palace enough, it is a truly magical hotel providing a truly magical stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a fabulous time and look forward to our next visit, unfortunately next year"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,nice
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Delightful. It was a special treat , from  friends and lived up to the occasion."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We flew to Bombay with friends to stay at the Taj, after seeing the 3 part TV program in UK.
It was brilliant if you are in the Palace wing, definitely 6 star, but the Tower wing has miserable, small, cheaply furnished rooms, hardly 4 star.
F&B is very expensive. One wine, which they sell in their own shop, is 7 times the price in the restaurants."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Simply say, this hotel is 10 stars hotel. They know how to touch people's  heart regarding all aspects which guests expect from hotel while staying."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Everything was convenient in terms of hotel service, location."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Actually, this is the best Hotel in the downtown area of Mumbai. The world-class service and food are remarkable. But be aware if you are a light sleeper, you can hear some traffic and other guests in palace wing, depending on your room.
Opt for the garden view. :)"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Stayed at the tower not the palace but the view of the Gate of India was great
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,perfect
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Among the hotels that i have stayed so far ,this hotel is magnificient in its service from the rooms and its staff.i enjoyed the breakfast buffet its was fantasitic."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was a lovely stay and got thoroughly spoilt. Will stay there again for sure if we ever happen to go to Mumbai again.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My husband and I came for three nights. We were impressed by this beautiful building and the rooms do not disappoint. The concept of service is taken to a new level here, with rose petals left in the room, extremely helpful staff, tours and staff falling over themselves to help you. For those worried about the water and traveller ailments associated with India, the taj has its own water purification facilities. Even the shower water is potable. Highly recommended. Just a note for first timers, there are two sections of the hotel - the tower which is new ,and the palace which is the regal, historical section."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Wonderful, would like to come back"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent stay. the recent renovations have made an amazing hotel even better. I will stay again on my next trip to Mumbai

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we had a wonderful time at the Taj - it felt like being home. A family atmosphere, super friendly and helpful staff and a great ambiente. Just the right place to relax and enjoy a beautiful location and also to participate in a lively city. many major sites are in walking distance and you can choose one of the many boat trips right in front of your door step."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent.  Staff were great.  Hotel spa is exceptional
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a wonderful experience on a whole but unfortunately the room that we had got was small in size. However, it's the quality that matters and it was really upto the mark. The luxurious lobby and the world class shopping experience is sufficient to pamper yourself."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Overall we had a fantastic stay, Mumbai was our last stop of our family trip to India, brilliant way to end a great holiday, Mumbai is one of the nicest, and the best places we visited in India..
The hotel was lovely we had 2 club rooms, in the Palace. My only complaint was that both at breakfast and during the cocktail hour we were kept waiting to enter before we could enjoy the facilities, however the timings were up held so if the cocktail hour was until 8 and you weren't able to enter the club room till late (due to lack of space) they would still stop serving at 8 which I though was a bit unfair, all guests should be accommodated accordingly, same with the breakfast, the sea lounge couldn't accommodate everyone at the busier times so you could be kept waiting outside for up to 20 mins, one of the mornings the buffet was being cleared away before we had even finished (the staff did let us know that this was about to happen but they had already started clearing it at the very same time so we didn't chance to enjoy breakfast properly) they did apologise after I complained. Again I didn't see it fair that after having had to wait (which I didn't mind) but then, that they would not then extend the timings accordingly allowing those guests to enjoy breakfast fully, they were very apologetic about this, I'm not sure if anyone else had complained about this but with all the attention to detail and high quality service I felt these were 2 areas (quite important though) do need looking, apart from this our stay was brilliant... my husband fell ill, they organised a doctor very quickly for us (who was very good).. oh and lastly I have to say how amazing the building tour guide was, unfortunately we cant remember the guys name, but he was fantastic!!So knowledgeable and entertaining!!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is a lovely hotel, we could have stayed longer. We will be back same time next year."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was meant to be a one off treat for me but having now stayed there I can never stay anywhere else if I go back to Mumbai. The little touches were just fabulous!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Like to stay longer and would come back immediately. Awesome hotel
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Simply superb! You will not find another hotel that has this level of attention to detail, this refinement of staff, and efficiency of facilities. Situated in the heart of Colaba, this hotel is truly the crown jewel in the Taj Hotel group's offerings. Thank you for an amazing stay!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We stayed high up in the tower with fantastic views overlooking the Gateway to India. The room was very comfortable and well furnished. The hotel has so many shops and places to wander around or just relax. Our only negative is the Relatively high price of drinks at the bar.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"A truly Taj Experience, Outstanding Hospitality. The hotel staff takes good care of their guests. Location is awesome in South Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,One of the most beautiful and comfortable hotel I have ever stayed. Everything was so good that I can easily say they can classify themselves as 7 star hotel.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Got free upgrade to palace wing again !! You guys are just awesome
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Great
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,After the hustle and bustle. The Taj is a please you can relax.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Amazing
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I couldn't have asked for a better first-time visit to Mumbai.  The Taj certainly lives up to its reputation as one of the best hotels in the world and my stay there made my trip to Mumbai even more special.  The warm care and service I received from the staff exceeded my expectations and I couldn't recommend this gem of a hotel more strongly.  I requested and was upgraded to a room in the palace section of the hotel which was utterly charming.  Should you ever have the opportunity to stay at this legendary hotel, do so.  It will be a very special experience."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Staffs were really nice and helpful.
Lobby was well-decorated.
But the room condition and breakfast were not superb as my expectation.
The hotel is a bit old, but the historically wealth for staying."

The location of hotel is on main road with good access airport and Mumbai shopping area Choice of bars and restaurants within the hotel is excellent. The staff made the difference service with a smile.  Enjoyed the stay and will definitely return."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I couldn't resist such an iconic opportunity. My wife didn't know I booked the Taj, and when we pulled up at 1am her jaw dropped. We spent 3 magnificent days in the ""old section"" which had a great mix of traditional architecture and modern comfort. My wife commented everyday that this was the best hotel experience ever. The staff was constantly doting on us, the breakfast over-looking the water or the pool were equally wonderful. To come so far and not stay here would be a shame, even for budget travelers. Everyone should stay here at least once."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Very good experience. Seamless check in and check out. Prompt and adequate service.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We were upgraded from the city view to the view of India Gateway- THE BEST. We checked in really late at midnight and requested for late check out. Without a second thought, we were given a 4pm check out with no additional charge. The housekeeping service was superb  - sweet minor details everyday. I would stay again without a second thought."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Pleasant,comfortable,very friendly and efficient staff."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,My stay was wonderful. Right from my arrival when I was greeted with a garland of flowers it was a great experience. After 3 days of travel it was an oasis of luxury and relaxation.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,This was an excellent experience. Staying at the Taj is an experience you want to have again
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent. The staff was courteous and attentive. The room was comfortable and clean with a great view  Perhaps replace the shower curtains - a funny thing to see in a hotel of this standard. Your hotel is well located  - for me that is the most important aspect.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj hotel in Mumbai is something different! Probalby the most awesome hotel I have ever been in from all the houndreds around the globe. It give u a true feeling of being a colonial king! Staff is amazing and helpful. They offer any kind of help you need. Got a bit of food poisoning when i stayed there but it could have come from something else too. location is good too, you can take the boat to elephanta island just outside the hotel. Be prepared for a crowded place!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a lovely stay at the Taj Mahal palace. The location is perfect, the pool and restaurant are really nice, the staff very helpful and competent. 
The food is abviously a bit pricey, but worth it considering the quality and the environment. 
We were upgraded and had a room with a view on the Gate of India. Just perfect!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"It's my second time at this hotel , and the reason behind coming back to it is because of the great food that the hotel resturant provide as well as the building of the hotel it's very classical and amazing. Colaba Area is one of the famouse location of shopping in Mumbai that is the second reason. I am sure I am coming back again .."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Totally amazing - looking forward to visting taj again very soon
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Amazing
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We loved staying here - from the moment we were picked up by the airport, we were treated with the utmost courtesy and thoughtfulness.  We are just ordinary travellers, who decided to treat ourselves to a special first three nights in India.  Nothing was too much trouble and we are very proud to have stayed at 'India's best hotel'!  A well deserved title."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fantastic stay! We stayed in the palace wing for 3 nights. If you do so make sure not to mix the lounge room with free coffee and tea and the cognac and chocolate hour every night. Also the hotel history tour (every day at 5/6) is an absolute must and will give you so much appreciation for the hotel. The breakfast is phenomenal and I'm still trying to figure out the smell of the hotel. It feels like you're home - only better!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,it was very nice stay
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Having spent two nights at the Taj, our stay was nothing short of pleasant. We encountered many staff members who were extremely hospitable. Mr. Mistry at Wasabi, Mr. Bhushan at the Sea Lounge, Mr. Moshin and Mr. Sunil by the pool and Ms. Ayesna (sp?) at the reception were very gracious and welcoming. 

There are a few short comings that are worth a mention.

1) No Wi-Fi without paying extra. There is absolutely no excuse for this. In today's world that's like saying you have to pay for the use of electricity and water while you stay at the hotel. I have stayed at multiple hotels around the world and many 2 and 3 star hotels provide free wifi to their guests. It's not about the cost it just makes you feel less guest-like when you are asked to pay for it. 
2) I noticed a lack of attention to certain details. For example the wine bottle in the mini bar was priced at Rs. 1800 but there was a sticker in the back that said the retail price was Rs. 1200. That's just shoddy presentation.
3) Although friendly overall, I felt like the security staff at the front could do a little more to welcome guests. It is true that their job is very serious but sometimes a smile or a nod can go a long way. Maybe the hotel could have a greeter  just past the security guards at the entrance to make the guests feel more welcome? This is after all the first contact that a guest has with the hotel's staff. 

Overall we were very pleased with our stay. I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to experience some of the best that Mumbai has to offer. The Taj Mahal Palace stands neck in neck with the top hotels of the world when it comes to hospitality."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Very good
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,My stay at Taj has been a lifetime experience. I was there to celebrate my birthday and the staff made sure that my special day turns out to be great. Thank you so much for the awesome hospitality.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fantasic. Taj is a fantastic hotel, in the best location. Dont be afraid to take a walk and visit all the cool design shops around the neighborhood like The Good Earth, Bungalow 8, and Bombay Electric. Lots of hecklers and beggars around (Unusual for rest of Mumbai), but I wouldnt worry about it. Politely decline and move on . Pool is nice. Great place to relax."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Excellent
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"One of my favourite hotel experiences! Staff were lovely, helpful, and went beyond to make my stay cushy and comfortable. I came back tired from work one day and the service staff had set up a complimentary foot soak and face mask for me to unwind with- it's these small touches that stood out to me most. Room was beautiful, felt quite plush, and very functional. This is a historical hotel with beautiful ornate furnishings and a fantastic view of the Gateway of India. Will definitely wish to return."

Every single staff member, facility, view and service available is designed to be an experience you will not forget / talk about forever - and hold up as a benchmark for other hotels (that won't come close). This is the hotel that I want to bring my future partner/love back too... or if I need to impress business colleagues just as equally! You will not be disappointed. Upgrade to a water view, upgrade to a palace view.. all great.. if you can't - just experience the hotel in all in beauty - whatever room type - they will not treat you differently.... and remember to go outside... the Gateway of India is just outside your door!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Was here for a holiday, then needed to stay for business/work. Internet speed was AWESOME - not slow/no shaving/no limits! Staff were awesome.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I've never ticker so many items in ""great things about this hotel"". The service is awesome (personalised). The staff are regular, attentive and knowledgable about you your interests, likes, issues - in a great way (not in a nosey way). The attention to detail and your experience - will make your stay amazing.! Take the tour!"

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I was with my family to spend a short holiday on insistance of my younger daughter who wanted to celebrate her last year in India before she moves out. We were in two adjecent rooms but as soon the staff came to know about my daughter she was treated for 4 days really like little Princess. Taj is a presitigious hotel in India and is the ultimate luxury one can experience. The rich heritage, colorful history and it's location is superb. The restaurants in the hotel are competing with each other but the hotels nearby are no less. We loved being at Leopod and LPQ just walking distance. If you wish to soak yourself with high class luxury ever, never miss Taj at Mumbai Kolaba."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We stayed for 1 night and it was very great. I felt like a royal in my palace. :)
Security is very tight which is a good thing. I would definitely love to come back and stay here when I am in Mumbai."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Truly one of the world's finest hotels, though you do pay for it.  Room in tower had spectacular view of harbor and Gateway of India.  Room wasn't as large or modern as similar hotels, but furnishing were top-notch and service was impeccable.  Dining was excellent -- be sure to enjoy afternoon tea in the Sea Lounge, lunch by the pool, and the signature drink in the Harbour Bar.  Don't waste your time with hotel tour, which was only an advertisement for hotel's shops and restaurants and light on the history."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,wonderfull
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,A nice thing to do.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,My stay at the Taj - as locals call it - was an unforgettable experience.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I was at Taj with my wife and Teenage daughter for vacation and we could not had it better. Right from the arrival till our stay we felt pampered. Taking care of our individual choices in breakfast and remembering  it for all four days of our stay touched us. My daughter was truly treated very special and was showered with every day surprise gift in her room including a cute bunny toy on day one (she is old enough for bunnies but she loved the attention). The daily morning tour of Hotel Taj is a memorable activity which must never be missed. You get to know very interesting historical facts about the hotel, Mumbai and Tatas (who built this hotel). Proximity to some wonderful restaurants in the vicinity is icing on the cake. The pool is fabulous and ever smiling staff is a treat to interact.
The rooms are not as big as you will find in some brand new luxury hotels but they are well kept, vintage look with all facilities. We were lucky enough to be booked into Palace part of the hotel (though we got the pool view as against sea view). If you are booking this for leisure be careful and check if your booked into Tower or the Palace. The tower (newly built part of the same hotel) is actually meant for business travelers."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. We were upgraded to a wonderful room in the palace wing with a fabulous view of the Gateway and sea. The evening tour of the hotel pointed out so many details we would have missed otherwise. There are beautiful flower arrangements throughout, very attentive and approachable staff. Attention to details made our stay above anything I have known before. Sunglasses left I the room would be joined by a glasses wipe. A book left on the table would have a bookmark left on it. Every time we returned to the room we were welcomed by such special touches. It was a privilege to stay here."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My stay at The Taj Mahal Palace was the single, best experience I have ever had in a hotel. I travel frequently to all sorts of places around the world, but my experience at The Taj Mahal Palace was phenomenal. I was delighted with the service, attitude and level of attention from the staff, and the property itself is purely majestic. To walk through the hotel is to feel like a king, and I would thoroughly recommend anyone to stay at this property as and when they have an opportunity. This is one of the last remaining places I have seen where you can experience the great tradition of Indian hospitality that has been such a feature for centuries in India. Great hotel, great staff, great stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Our 3 night stay at the Taj made our visit to Bombay one of the most enjoyable trips.Have been to Bombay various times but this was the first time at the Taj and would definitely stay at the Taj during our future visits.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Stay was great. After spending a few weeks in cheap guesthouses it was a nice change for a few nights. Comfy bed, hot shower, in room safe and across the road from the Gateway of India. Good cheap food not far away and top notch security."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Lovely Indian service, warm welcome (with flowers) and a drink.  Stayed in the Palace Wing (highly recommend as this section has been renovated) with a room overlooking the Gateway to India.  Wonderful service, attention to detail in the room (from thoughtful small gifts to the staff inserting a Taj Palace bookmark in my book where they saw I had turned down a page corner).  Rooms and baths are well appointed and the property is beautifully maintained, clean and comfortable.  Beds were perfect.  I can't say a negative thing about this property."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I enjoyed my stay at Taj Mahal hotel
The service was very good
The staff was very welcoming and nice
Clean Room clean bathroom as well 
The room service was fast and The food was Delicious.

The only two things i didn't love about the hotel was the 3G conection was so bad , and the maids was asking too much about the Cleaning and if im ok with their cleaning !
Whats so annoying about it that they ask more than 3/2 times A DAY
They even call from the reception if you tried to ignore a little but just to ask you if everything was ok 
Personally i dont like to keep answering the door or the phone more than once when i try to Relax 
Specially when its about the same question !"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,We have stayed at the Palace section before and we got much better service there than staying at the a tower section. Breakfast and the service at breakfast was not very good.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My stay in the hotel gave mix feelings, while the service was nothing to complaint, the food was amazing in Japanese and Indian restaurants even the bakery. The tea served here was also great. But there are some problem of sound proof, I stay on 6th floor but still can hear car horn sound from the city below, which sometime so loud that disturb my sleeping, quite dissapointing on this matter."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I travel extensively for work and pleasure, and I can safely say that this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff literally bend over backwards to accommodate any request, and the building itself has a beautiful and fascinating history. Ask for a sea view room overlooking India Gate - worth the premium price."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The stay was very pleasant.  We will stay again at the Taj when we visit Mumbai in future.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Recommend because of history and location.  Concierge most helpful.  Atmosphere cold with no welcoming touches in room.  Not happy to be given a smoking room and staff made little effort to relocate us.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had originally booked in the tower section of the hotel. The rooms were average, nothing great. We requested to be moved to The Palace. Despite the increased charge, the upgrade was amazing. The rooms were large, beautiful and extremely clean. The attention to detail could be seen in the smallest things. The service was unbelievable with cleaning staff leaving beautiful messages on our pillows, placing bookmarks in our books and going extra lengths to make our stay comfortable."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We spent a month in India at less expensive hotels but for the one night we stayed here we were treated like royalty (despite clearly not being!) and enjoyed the luxury. Breakfast was included, a buffet of international range and quite easily one of the best we've ever had anywhere! Everything else at taj is extra tho (e.g. WiFi was 700 rupee/hr) and bar prices matched london."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"It was not worth the money, not in the chaos of Xmas, like stepping into a shopping mall full of tourists when alighting the lift. No internet room is crazy in this level of luxury. Food very ordinary...2restaurants booked out could only have Xmas lunch round the pool!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"nice quiet surroundings, in room router for wifi although you pay for internet, staff very helpful, great buffet breakfast. wouldn't change much."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"My stay here was far too short!  I was in Mumbai for business and really didn't get to see much of the city.  The best part of my stay was the view from the room.  I looked out onto Gateway to India and it was so beautiful to see at sunrise!  The weather in Mumbai was amazing.  Warm, sunny, not too cold at night.  People were out on the streets until midnight, just enjoying the weather.  The breakfast was quite good and I enjoyed eating out by the pool area.  The wifi is great in the hotel and can be accessed from all areas of the hotel.  Unfortunately, they do charge about US$20/day for wifi.  Would be better if it were free! I would stay here again."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"One of best hotel in Asia. value for moeny compared to other heritage hotels.
Breakfast varaiation"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"GREAT EXPERIENCE.....!!  UNPARALLEL SERVICE STANDARDS, CUSTOMISED SERVICE, TREAT YOU LIKE A KING...QUALITY FOOD, FLEXIBLE CHECKIN / CHECK OUT, HIGH SPEED INTERNET,"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Truly first class
A little too busy the front and lobby, give the recent past experience but safety of the hotelier taken care off...
Very glad I stayed here"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Absolutely amazing hotel!
Best trained staff in the world!
The hotel made you want to stay longer and longer as the staff truly make you feel so special!
Gorgeous on both sides - the heritage club side and the lesser expensive tower side - stayed in both !
The only thing I didn't like is that thei wifi is charged extra - which for such a high end hotel should be complimentary and that it kicks you off the network and you have to constantly log in again- which is a royal pain.."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"goood but not recommended for Arabs people because non of the 80 channels in the hotel TV is Arabic, so Arabs will feel bored in the rooms"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It has good location to visit and has history hotel. Service in the hotel is very good and make me feel comfortable. It deserved to visit again.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fabulous stay with great service from all in the hotel! The only tiny complaint I have will be the tiny shower cap that could not fit any adult! 
Great restaurants by foot include Indigo, Leopold and the hotel Italian and Chinese restaurants!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We had a great stay at the Taj. From the moment we entered, we were treated like royalty. From being garlanded and given some tea in reception to giving us a complimentary gift for staying with them. It truly is a beautiful hotel, very opulent. the breakfast is sooo good, very big variety. This is the hotel to stay in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Excellent stay, the staff are fantastic. Booking ongoing flights, advice on tours and attraction. Business application etc.  I can't fault anything about this hotel."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Cannot be faulted. Excellent on all levels. Golden dragon resturant is amazing.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We initially booked for the Basic superior room located in the Tower wing. Although they upgraded us to a Deluxe room in the Tower wing facing the Arabian Sea we were still very disappointed at the room size, ceiling height, bathroom size and the general atmosphere within. It was by no way 5 star standards given the high price we booked at. We called the reception and complained. They offered to show us rooms in the Palace Wing. Believe me when I say this, one was heaven and the other was hell. Significant difference and much to our liking. Unfortunately we had to pay extra which blew up our budget for the trip but I think it was worth it. They did upgrade us to the Taj Club which had more facilities and privileges attached. If anyone is traveling to Taj Mahal, you need to book in the Palace Wing. Otherwise choose some other 5 star hotels. Overall the staff were friendly and attentive. And they gave us a lot of pleasant surprises in our room every night. Very personal touch. As we were celebrating our 3rd year wedding anniversary they gave us a nice cake on arrival. Great service and personal attention to detail! Housekeeping did a fantastic job and making the room feel welcoming every time we step foot in it away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai life. Enjoyed the high tea, evening cocktails and 'chocolate n cognac'  which were a treat available free for Taj Club patrons."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I stayed at the Tower. You have a heritage wing of the hotel with Suites which looks luxurious but I cannot comment on that.
The Tower rooms were not very impressive. The decor looks dated and the room had an aged look to it. The food was nothing great with not a very big spread on breakfast. I have been at better business hotels in Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fabulous. And extraordinary after service, when I left some belongings there that were forwarded to me."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"It will be SHOCKED while you come into this FANTASTIC hotel in the 1st time, that is a very dreamful exp as you comes into a Bollywood Scene. STRONGLLY recommand this hotel as your 1st stay in Mumbai. you will feel that you are in the heart of this amazing city."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,every thing was great I will tell every one to go this hotel via agoda
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"First time stay in Taj mumbai, i had a quality stay, the best hospitality by their friendly staff, tasted the best indian cuisine.
Highly recommended for leaser and business travelers."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,HISTORIC STAY WITH FANTASTIC ACCOMODATION AND GREAT STAY WITH
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Pool was really good. I wanna stay this hotel again.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"the Taj Mahal Palace is an institution and a proud part of Indian history. Of course this comes at a price. The tower rooms are as good as any other hotel of its category, but the position and the view - right opposite the gateway to India - and the elegance of the old part of the hotel give it an extra edge. You stay here for the experience as much as the facilities - and it is an experience!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Very comfortable stay in Old Wing room; beautiful ornate rooms; lovely pool setting; exemplary attentive, courteous and friendly service; undoubtedly one of Indias finest hotels."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Was there for a weekend trip. Really enjoyed our stay. It was my mom's b'day and the staff of Taj made the day very special for her!!! It is the best of all the Taj hotels that we have stayed in!!
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. My friend and i are budget travellers, when we were going through Lonely Planet - India, we saw that this hotel was 'splurgeable'. 75% of our travel budget went to this hotel, but no regrets. WELL WORTH IT!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"What should i say... it is an extraordinary place to stay. We could afford only one night in the Taj buj it was worth it. We had the best breakfast of all hotels so far. The inner garden with the large swimming pool realy takes you back in history due to its apperence.

Great Hotel with a lot of History"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Best experience. great hotel and service was excellent
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I have extanted my stay from 19 to 28 and then from 29 to 4 July
Very happy if I go back I will only stay same hotel taj"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,My stay at the hotel was excellent.  I will definely come back
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We travelled around India for nearly four months and this was our last stop off point before flying home.  From the effortless welcome, the rooms to checking out, it was superb - the best of the best."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,just the best
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I happened to be a guest on my birthday. They had my whole room flooded with red heart shaped baloons, bed was decorated, a bouquet of flowers and a large chocolate cake. This was a real treat for someone travelling on business on birthday, away from family."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Only downside to this hotel is you had to pay  for wifi which in my experience comes  free in most hotels .Wifi is also very expensive.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"In a nutshell.....well worth it.....right accross from the Gateway of India, the hotel itself is a Heritage Site, no security concerns after the last attack, great and professional staff, clean rooms and a range of cuisine to choose from......"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Fantastic hotel, room was large and extremly well furnished. The staff were polite and attentive. he facilities were in th hotel were very good business centre and the pool and gym facilites were very good. Internet charges were quite high for hotel of this stature and should have included in the charges for the room. definatley stay again"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is great and is in the city , good ocean view and one of the famous sightseeing spot."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Nice stay love the hotel
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The purpose of my visit was mainly shopping. 
I requested a double bed room, but was given a room with two single beds.  I requested a change an immediate change which I got. I was glad that I opted for a room with a double bed as it was slightly larger and more spacious.  The room was comfortable and clean, but not as luxurious as I had expected. The bed was rather uncomfortable - I expected a plush, soft mattress.  I have stayed in the Leela Kempinski near the airport a few times and in comparison, their rooms are a lot more luxurious and the beds are extremely comfortable.
The location of this hotel was excellent for my purpose of visit - shopping.  It was not too far a distance from the areas that I wanted to visit.  
The breakfast was decent.  Not an extensive variety but enough choices.  The staff at the restaurant were extremely attentive without being intrusive.  However, breakfast on Saturday was not a good experience at all - I requested for hash browns to go with my scrambled eggs which didn't arrive.  When I inquired I was told it had been forgotten!  When it finally did arrive it was under cooked; not the nice golden colour one would expect.  By this time I was fed up and was and had long finished my scrambled eggs.  however, the supervisor insisted on getting the perfectly golden hash browns, which i finally got!  my request for waffles was also forgotten - they weren't good anyway.
Pastries and cakes - not good.
Good variety of fruits. Dosa was delicious.  Highlight was the fresh honey with honeycomb - loved that!
All in all a  pleasant stay.  As this was my first stay in Taj group of hotels I was expecting a little more luxury!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,At a hotel like this I would expect free wifi. There are lots of taxis near the front of the hotel or you can arrange transport through the hotel. Great view of India Gate and and a great overall experience.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Staying at the Taj Mahal Palace was truly the most superb hotel experience I have ever had, and probably ever likely to have. The staff could not have been more attentive, but were never over-bearing. The pool and breakfast room were gorgeous, and I had the best night sleep I'd had in months. If you're travelling to Mumbai, the Taj Mahal is a must!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Great for a night, but not sure worth the money for an extended stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"When i arrived we were welcome by a welcome flower. The staff there is very helpful and they even escort you to the room and show you the surroundings. In the hotel you are surrounding with the aroma oil and it smells great! The staff is very helpful, they help us to become the translator when we call upon a taxi. It's a good stay and you will feel the different India especially when you look out from the room window. The gateway of India just in front of you! It looked beautiful when sunrise and sunset!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This luxery hotel was surely that.  The staff could not do enough for you, running back to add breakfast items, negotiating taxi service, or simply saying hello with a smilt.  The Taj is a great place, after a site seeing blitz, to take some time off.  Try the high tea in the Sea Lounge you will not be disappointed.  The only weak point is paying for internet access, that needs to change."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Stands up to its reputation as an excellent hotel.Those who are in doubt, try a breakfast around the pool area."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"An oasis in the middle of chaos.  The Taj Mahal Palace is so iconic of India.  We live in India and staying here was just something we needed to do.  While staying in the new tower isn't as exciting as the classic part of the hotel, it is a great deal on the weekends.  You still get access to the beautiful pool and fantastic restaurants.  Service is top-notch.  Oh, and be sure to check out high tea.  It's amazing and you won't need much for dinner after that.  Get there early to get a booth on the window to look out at the water and India Gate.  You'll feel like the king and queen of the town watching the world go by."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,It was a great place. Location superb as it is near the beach and also near the shopping centres. Service was also good. Over all this hotel is good. The business centre also good. The staff are friendly.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Everything from the rooms to the staff to the breakfast, the gym, the swimmingpool is completely amazing! I have never been to a more positive and great hotel! Wow!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Highly professional yet friendly service by very personable staff make the ""Taj experience"" all that one hopes for in a legendary hotel.  The details that combine to make this a smooth, pleasant experience include courtesy, clear communication, under-lights in bathroom for easy access in the dark, quality towels and toiletries, quiet, fast elevators and carpeted corridors.
Bed linen was crisp yet dreamy soft, the good desk had a view of the Arabian Sea."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"originally booked a tower room, but upon arrival we were given an upgrade to the palace wing. room was amazing: marble bathroom, comfortable bed with many pillow options, beautiful and calming decor. it was a total paradise and welcome escape from the overwhelming atmosphere that one can be confronted with in india. buffet breakfast was nice. you can also get beef at the restaurants... so spaghetti bolognese was a welcome luxury after 2 weeks of classic indian food."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We stayed in the club rooms in the old part of the hotel. Hotel is absolutely beautiful. Pool area was great to relax. Service was impeccable and the location was great, in the best area of Mumbai."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,End of a hard month of traveling perfect end of the stay. Worth every penny
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"it is one of the horrible hotel  of taj brand in india...stinking actors the hotel due to horse , non maintained room with half of amenities not working, uncleared floors...
most importantly very poor internet services.. rude and arrogant behavior of restaurant during breakfast and dinner.. and very ordinary quality of food....

overall, waste of money to stay with taj mahal hotel, 

people stay because of its location"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"this will be my only choice to stay for all my future trips to mumbai. the service is fantastic, the standards exceptionally high and the food excellent. this is a must experience for all who can or who can not (like us) afford it."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"a very pleasant stay. however, room did not have a view worh mentioning"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The Taj Mahal Palace offered very good personel service. The room service is perfect, at times a bit slow. The restaurant services are excellent. The morning breakfast buffet is a wonderful combination of Indian and Western Continental style food.
The tropical garden near the pool is nice. At times the black crows try to pick on the food if your not awear."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,it was so awesome being part of one of india's oldest heritage with excellent class service n hospitality
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Loved everything about this place.  Impeccable service, beautiful setting, lovely hotel, amazing water feature tribute to those who lost their lives in the terrorist attack, great security, wonderful food,they don't miss a thing, making your stay a pleasure."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The building and rooms are beautiful, like a Palace. Thus the place needs to be renovated. No modern shower, only a bath tub with a shower. The pool area is very loud. The food in the Pool side restaurant poor. The breakfast is a threat for your figure, you get everything you like - they offer a huge variety. The Spa is nice, I had a great massage. Gym is ok, friendly personal trainers are available.
Service is great!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our view  from the tower over the Gate to India spectacular.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"just a perfect place to be
experience the 'old wing' part to embrace this hotel and part of Mumbai's history"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I came down with a terrible stomach bug my first day in Mumbai and the hotel not only looked after my physical health with a superb doctor and immediate delivery of necessary medicine, they also lifted my spirits with small gestures of kindness.  At every instance the staff showed genuine concern that my stay be as pleasant as possible which was especially notable 
as I was confined, due to illness, to the hotel for an entire week.  I can not say enough wonderful things about the depth of dedication to their guests each and every member of the staff projects.   This is the ultimate in 5 star service with a genuine smile.  Thank you to all the gracious people who took such good care of me and to the owners who are clearly dedicated to making the experience of each guest a complete delight."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The hotel is amazing comparing to your other generic 5 star hotels.  They offered us a late check out until 3 or a half day rate until 9 pm if you those late flight.  The pool, sauna, steam room and gym were also free to use.  The location is perfect as you can see the gate way to india from your room and walk to the boat the elephant island.  The only gripe is you have to pay for Wifi but thats pretty much the same for other in class."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we absolutely loved every minute of our stay at the taj.  all the workers were incredibly helpful and pleasant, especially roop who did the hotel tour and glen at the concierge desk.  everyone did their absolute best to accommodate you and make sure you had a pleasant stay.  we originally had booked a tower room (we didn't realize at the time of booking), when we had shown up to check in they gave us a free upgrade.  this kind of thing never happens to my wife and i, so we were perplexed, but incredibly excited.  needless to say, i recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again in the future."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"since it was not the first time that i was a guest in the taj mahal hotel mumbai, i new, what i am going to expect. it is so far the best hotel i have visited ever. ther is realy nothing to complain. the only thing maybe is, that the spa area should get renovated."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"We stayed in the tower and had great views over the Gateway, people to one side and the boats to the other. The service was exceptional. The room was okay, nothing fantastic. I'd expect more for just shy of 200GBP. Dinner at the Masala Kraft restaurant was nice, but overpriced. The swimming pool and spa are lovely."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is the first hotel we've ever stayed in where the hotel experience was the highlight of the whole of our time in a city - Mumbai is hard work, but the Taj makes it very bearable. From the moment that reception uttered those words that every travellor hopes for, ""we have upgraded you sir"", we felt like kings. The ambience of the Palace wing (completely refurbished after the 2008 terrorist attack), the exemplary service, the complimentary cocktails and the cognac and chocolate nightcap made the stay here a highlight of 5 weeks in India. Splurge if you can - it's worth every penny."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"made my 2 year infant feel so special 
great welcome
breakfast spead disappointed"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Stayed in Nov 2012 - King Room Superior w/ Sea View

* Incredible vista of waterfront and Gateway
* Amazing hospitality from check-in staff at arrival (great ideas like flight check-in)
* Nice pool.
* Free guided walks of hotel and area (very interesting).
* Great breakfast. Wasabi restaurant can be missed - terrible value for money and you would expect better service/decor/quality."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,we always love staying at the taj - all things considered best hotel in mumbai.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is a wonderful hotel.
The staff are well informed and friendly and will help with anything you may want.
The pool is beautiful, the rooms large and clean and the location is very good."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,A beautiful hotel with delightful staff. Fantastic stay and would definitely come back.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I transferred to the Raj hotel from another 5 star Mumbai hotel following a recommendation from one of my suppliers.

Probably the best decision of my trip to Mumbai.

The one and only criticism I have is that the bathrooms in the Tower rooms are somewhat dated and lack a separate shower."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Very efficient staff who do everything possible to make their guests comfortable.

Being extremely critical the only negative point is that the rooms  in the Tower Wing are quite small for a hotel of this calibre and, space permitting, it would be good to have a separate shower cubicle."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Definitely lived up to the famous hotel that it is, stunning location overlooking the gate of India, you will not be disappointed by staying here, we loved every minute of our stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"i stayed here with my baby daughter and staff were very helpful and friendly to make it a comfortable stay. 
the restaurants are beautiful and its a pleasure to wander the hallways and lobby. many galleries and restaurants close by to keep you busy. i recommend the high-tea at sea view lounge for a relaxiing afternoon."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I stayed for a night and had a great time there. Services were excellent, staffs were very nice, room was spacious. Everything was very good. Would like to come back next time. Thanks a lot, Taj!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This is the best hotel we have ever stayed at anywhere in the World. Words cannot describe the opulence,charm and depth of this incredible establishment. It is very clear that absolute passion is what drives every single employee here, many of which have worked here for 15 years or more. The service and room and hotel appointments in general are astonishing. It's eye opening and breattaking from the minute you enter the building. What can I say....take me there again now!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Upon arrival we received an upgrade to the Palace section & were guided to that reception area. Check-in was done in a second without the usual delays & filling out forms & the bags brought up instantly. We were welcomed in the traditional manner. 

The hotel is an oasis of quiet luxury in the hot & noisy maelstrom that is Bombay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This was by far the best hotel that we have ever stayed at. THe service was outstandig and the attention to detail was really amazing. On our first morning, when the newspaper was delivered to the room, the front page of the Syndey MOrning Herald was also delivered (to keep us in touch with news back home). Concierge services were excellent- nothing was too hard, or to difficult! Shops in the lobby were great as well. THe view from the room was perfect and the bed was so comfortable, but the breakfast in the Sea Lounge was the best part- the best tea I have ever had with the absolute best service!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we chose to stay in this hotel because:
- my indian friends said it's the hotel in mumbai
- it was featured in mi4 (note that the movie only showcased the ballroom and the suite floor... when u stay in this hotel, will u be going to the ballroom or the suite floor?)

why i won't stay in this hotel again:
- the staff is always hungry for tips. i'm not sure if it's because tom cruise tipped all the staff $ bills each or it's just the general attitude in mumbai... my friend and i was carrying 2 small luggage, a staff offered to bring them up to our room and we didn't have small change to tip him so we smiled ""thank you."" he just stayed there waiting... staring at us with an odd grin. we said ""thank you"" again but he dind't leave. so we ended up giving him $5-> my indian friend said a tip of $1-2 is the norm for hotel staff... and this happened again to us when we were leaving the hotel. 
- the front desk is unfriendly and a little unprofessional. we requested for room on higher floor, quieter, facing the ocean. she didn't even tell us what room she gave us and smiled ""here's you key, your room is ready."" when we went up we realized, she gave us room on 4th floor, facing the main town, which is full of honking noise until 1am... we were too tired to argue as we checkin in at 1030pm.

why we might return to this hotel:
- best location in mumbai... unless there'll be a new hotel built in the area soon! i hope this happens! plenty of amazing restaurants walkable from the hotel... and it's relatively safe because there is a college nearby~"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"i spent a couple of days in the taj mahal palace. it was excellent. if you would like to be treated as a real guest, spend some nights in this hotel. you will enjoy everything, from the rooms, the breakfast, the pool and the luxury stores and service!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,A beautiful hotel which takes you back to feeling like you are living in the 1920's. The highlights were the breakfast and the hightea. Situated in a perfect position for endless shopping with markets and brand stores stretched all around the area. Will definitely stay again if I'm ever back in Mumbai. The buffet breakfast was Plentiful and great quality.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Absolutely beautiful hotel - we were upgraded as we were on our honeymoon and our room was absolutely beautiful
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"I stayed here just two days,  but it was an unforgettable experience.   The hotel staff are extremely helpful and always trying to address the needs of the customer. 

I had a room overlooking the India Gate which was a rewarding experience.   

The hotel also several wonderful restaurants including international,  Indian, and Chinese cuisines.   All of them were magnificent.  

The Spa was best I have ever experienced in India."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Stunning grand hotel in the heart of the Colaba area, within 5 minuntes walking distance to great shopping and eating district. Best breakfast, with 5 star service.

Rooms in the tower building felt a little dated and in need of an upgrade.

Overall experience was fantastic and highly reccommened for couples, or even families with young children."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"checked in here for three nights after a horrid stay at the midland hotel.  
it has a provenance that makes it dear to the indian people and others around the 
world.    speaking to other guests, it was a reason they also chose this hotel.
the breakfast is delicious and you can have it around the pool which is beautiful and heated.
the room was very comfortable with a step out balcony.  make sure you take the free
five o'clock evening tour."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"After a couple of months of travelling in India staying at places from we decided to stay at the Taj. The guidebooks seemed to be down on Mumbai and hotels at about and below had very mixed reviews...it was my wife's birthday too so we decided to splurge. It was wonderful: spotless, comfortable, and gracious staff -- even to a couple of old hippies who had been washing their clothes in hotel sinks for weeks."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our stay here was excellent from start to finish.  We were treated like royalty, enjoyed the absolute most comfortable bed in a beautiful room with a stunning view, swam in a gorgeous pool, and ate delicious food at the restaurant.  The location of the hotel couldn't be better, allowing us to walk to interesting shops, sights, and restaurants.  Our questions were answered promptly and with attention to detail.  I haven't a single negative point about this hotel.  Worth every penny!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,there was a problem with our hotel driver and we have ended up waiting over an hour at an empty airport (late night) before someone finally turned up.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Although its the Taj Mahal, there is a difference between being a guest in the 'Palace' and the 'Towers'.... Its supposed to be international standard, but its a bit grubby. The staff are good, friendly and efficient."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"NB This review is for VIVANTA By TAJ MALABAAR

Check in procedure is prompt and relaxed, individual attention seated within the lobby area.
The rooms had sea views and are clean with everything you need. Bathrooms had great electronic blinds!
There are various activities -  there is a boat trip every day at 5pm to see great sunsets by chinese fishing nets, traditional indian dance and great ayurvedic spa treatments.
The staff go out of their way to help.
As with most Indian hotels the wine is really expensive and Indian wine not always very good. Sula is the best if you want to try it."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"upon arrival service was second to none. offered incredibly early check-in and very late check out. checked things like air miles cards to ensure i could claim points. 
upgraded to superior room, although i must admit a real disapointment. stayed in the tower rooms, the room was standard 5 star affair and not something to remember, no seperate shower - very small space. felt old and certainly will consider paying a lot more for the palace rooms. outside the room the hotel was an incredible experience. excellent service throughout, the pool area was beautiful and peaceful. breakfast was ok. looking forward to taking a palace room next time."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we had some initial trepidation about staying at the taj mahal palace after the incident in 2008.  however, the charm of the place and the fantastic service at all levels of the hotel just won us over the moment we checked in.  there are also abundant f&b choices in and around the hotel.  being sited next to the historical gateway to india puts us close to the hustle abd bustle of the city but yet we are safely ensconced in the peace and quiet of the hotel."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we enjoyed our stay very much at this grand hotel. early check-in and late check and we made the most out of our time here, including a dip in the pool."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"i am myself the owner of a luxury small hotel and i must admit that travelling around the world in many palaces , i never had such a luxury experience

out of the fact that this historical hotel himself and the location , the service and the kindness and efficiency of the staff is a lesson to take for any person working in this industry.

close to perfection 

i will return and will keep the best remember of this experience in such a beautiful palace"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This building stands out in Apollo Bandar, a massive palace on the waterfront. The service was exceptional except for one very annoying point: when I checked in for my two night stay, I asked to have a late check out on the last day. The concierge said somebody would call me about it. No call the first day. The second day I rang the front desk and asked again. They said I'd get a call, again no call. The day of my checkout I called to ask, they said they'd get back to me. They rang back - half an hour before check out time, to say it would not be possible! Very inconvenient that they did not let me know earlier. Other than that, great place to stay!

Wait, one more thing - the mediterranean rooftop restaurant is terrible. Vastly overpriced and average food - although I had just been in Beirut... try some of the restaurants in the apollo bandar area instead, many great ones to choose from"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"everything totally 5 star, up to snuff; nothing lacking, usa/european prices...everything. an experience of the old raj india, not the current india...but a unique out of the past stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"housed in a 1903 building with a modern tower extension, our room was a mix of old-world charm andv indian elegance. the public areas reflect moorish, oriental, indian and florentine influences with vaulted ceilings, hand-woven carpets and crystal chandeliers.

there's a pool and fantastic spa and if you stay in one of the suites you get breakfast, happy hour cocktails and a bed time brandy for free.
¬†
the x-factor is that there are eight restaurants serving a wide range of cuisines, including eastern mediterranean at the rooftop souk and japanese at wasabi by morimoto."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,i just regret being so shortly in the hotel. the view from the rooms over the bay is wonderful. personal very friendly and helpful all the time. by the price of a breakfast you can eat a wonderful dinner at the restaurants surrounding the hotel.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"we were upgraded to the palace tower. the hotel had so much character and so rich in culture with the art pieces generously displayed along the hallways. it is really living in a palace! 
check in was done by the duty manager while we waited in a private lounge.
the lobby of the tower was exclusive and had a beautiful fresh flower arrangement. 
a lifetiime experience!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Staff treated us like Royality and were extremely helpful and caring. My wife was sick for the evening and we ordered room service. The waiter went beyond the call of duty and made herbal medicine to cure her cold. The restuarant staff and breakfast staff guided us in the selection of the cuisines we wished to eat which we thoroughly enjoyed. The porters and travel desk were very helpful and the hotel even discounted some of the items on my bill, to my surprise. Excellent choice to stay at the hotel to experience the Taj Royalty, I will most definitely go back to the Taj

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"this is a world class hotel and everything lives up to that standard. when things went wrong (our new year's car was ordered for 2013 not 2012) they compensated us immediately and went out of their way to make our stay even more memorable.

all the food they served was 1st class and the service knowleagable and attentive"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Taj mahal is one of finest and oldes hotel in mumbai it before freedom
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Arrived very early, but our rooms were available. Not only that, the hotel upgraded us to their Palace Rooms. Which included free drinks at certain times. We were so well looked after by the ever present and helpful staff. A weekend to remember. Would highly recommend for any special occasion."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,i was only able to stay for one night but i was very impressed by  the service. i enjoyed the use of the spa and the pool as well as the bar and restaurant areas. every member of staff was welcoming and helpful. a fantastic stay
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,we had stayed at the taj mahal palace for 3 nights and was well worth every penny spent. it was a wonderful experience and we have not one flawed memory of the entire stay there. from the onset of our interaction with staff they were always pleasant and attentive. the attention to detail and service were impeccable. the decor is luxurious and tasteful. it was the perfect place to end our holiday in india.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"this historic place is just a great place to stay. it is centrally located and you get the comfort you expect im india for a 5 star hotel. it is important to know that the palace and the tower is connected and room categories are different. the palace, as the name suggests, is better to stay with. the rooms in the tower are good, and with carpet rather a bit smelly. nevertheless the common area is shared and is just a gorgeous fairy-tale blend of islamic and renaissance styles."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"whether you are passing through or staying a while, this is a great hotel. if you go to mumbai and have not visited the taj tower and palace, you have short changed yourself.
you have a choice; the tower is cheaper and the palace is superb, but both worth staying at."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"This time we stay in the tower side, but actualy the palace side should be the heritage part, thats a little bit not in our expectation. but the room is great and serveice as well."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"the superior rooms in the tower section are very value. you have access to almost all of the same top quality facilities as those staying in the palace. the gateway of india and colaba causeway is just outside. if you like shopping close at hand, this is ideal, plus loads of excellent restaurants."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"The rooms are very large, clean and well-equipped.  The high ceilings are very nice.  The bathtub is also one of the larger ones I've seen.  Although the building has never been a 'palace', you can imagine exactly how living in one would be like.  

The service is also remarkable.  The service staff seem genuinely eager to help you with any and all request, none to small.  They even offered to help my pack my bags the night before i checked out! The pride within each employee of the Taj is very obvious and this comes shining through with their impeccable service."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,The Taj Hotel is a very nice hotel however the rooms are starting to become quite dated and very old style looking a bit tired. The internet was a good connection however they charge per device unlike most other hotels. The restaraunts were very expensive and food quality was not that great. bar food was particularly expensive as was the simple buffet despite much better offerings for lower prices at other Indian hotels. Car hire was also very expensive compared to other hotels. TV was very old and did not work properly despite asking for it to be fixed.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Pleasant.  Room with nice view. Staff very eager to please and helpful.  Nicely decorated public areas.  Breakfast very nice and pleasant atmosphere all round. Location good for downtown (MG road etc.)
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Pros:
- Courteous and helpful staff
- Great restaurants (try Wasabi!)
- High security
- Beautiful hotel surroundings (the pool area is a nice place to sit back and relax)
- Excellent breakfast

Cons:
- Was really disappointed with the television in the room. It looked like it was from the 1980s! I had been travelling in India for three weeks and had stayed in some hotels that cost a third of what the Taj Tower Wing cost and they had bigger flat screen televisions! Time for an upgrade Tata!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Excellent hotel with really great service.
Heritage palace wing with beautiful interiors.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Complete mess at the hotel entrance.  No parking facilities. Rooms out dated, need renovation. Prices totaly over standart. Who is not on buisseness in Mumbai should avoid going to this city. Never again."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Our family spent several days to celebrate a special occasion and were overwhelmed by special attention to detail to make our stay memorable - welcome surprises at every turn: wine, flowers, rose petals decorating our bed, cakes, cards and small gifts from staff.  Excellent breakfast buffet and high tea."

Very comfortable hotel for business and holidays travel,
The hotel car for pick up us very good."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Wonderful 5* beautiful hotel. A palace in every sense of the word. I was upgraded from a tower room to a palace room which was a bonus. Checkin was a dream with special Indian welcome ceremony. I have never seen so much granite in the bathroom. Sadly I was a solo traveller but i'm sure we could have fitted 10 people in the huge and ornate shower room!
Downside - although I got a very good room rate with Agoda drink and food charges in the hotel are astronomical - 500 rupees for a cup of tea or coffee! I also felt very guilty being in such luxury when millions live in the poverty and squallor of the Mumbai slums!"
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Incredible hotel, loved the stay. very close to great market too and amazing view of the gate...."

staff were pleasant and helpful. location was convenient but over-rated. breakfast was very good and refreshing. gym was excellent. foyer was beautiful and comfortable. will revisit."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Bet location for tourist as Gateway of India is just opposite the hotel with ferry to Elephanta Caves. Also, street shop along Colaba Causeway is 2 block away behind the hotel.Breakfast with great choice of variety of food including Indian, western, etc. Value for money as I have a good rate booked through Agoda.com. Definetely come back or recommend to friends whenever visiting Mumbai again. The only set back is that the carpet inside my room was aged and need to replace
and room house keeping need to upgrade as the keeper has not done a good job during my stay."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"An ideal hotel to stay for tourist without budget limitation. A little expensive compare to US hotel with similar rating. Considering Mumbai hotel rate, its value for money for a 5* hotel. To maintain the high rating,the Management should considering changing the aged room carpet, improve house-keeping. Upkeep the high standard of restaurant service and quality of foods .Will stay in this hotel again and recommend to friends visiting Mumbai."

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Es un hotel de lujo que merece la pena visitar. El servicio es excelente al igual que la limpieza pero las habitaciones son relativamente sencillas.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Jeg bodde i 2 omganger, der den f√∏rste hadde et d√•rlig rom med fukt og d√•rlig lukt. Kl√¶r ble fuktige p√• rommet, og teppegulvet var fuktig. (rom 1201) Rommet hadde utsikt mot byen. P√• det andre oppholdet fikk jeg et nydelig rom, med utsikt, ikke teppegulv, rent og deilig (rom 320). Fikk veldig bra service, sen sjekk-ut, hyggelig staff og et langt bedre opphold enn det f√∏rste."
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,Fantastisk hotell med vennlig betjening og flotte rom. F√∏lelsen av √• bo midt i historien. Anbefales for alle.
Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Som en r√∂d tr√•d genom min vistelse var den otroligt trevliga/serviceminded personalen, bara att the doorman som √∂ppnade d√∂rren p√• bilen sa v√§lkommen tillbaka var imponerande, hade mailat om att bli h√§mtad p√• flygplatsen vilket var smidigt, s√§tta dig tillr√§tta i baks√§tet och f√• ett kitt med fuktiga handdukar att fr√§scha upp dig med, vatten och minttabletter fick man ocks√•. 
Kommer man med tidigt morgonflyg g√•r det p√• ca 40 min in till hotellet annars ca 1,20 min.

Bem√∂tandet med en v√§lkomstseremoni med blomband och f√§rgdutt i pannan var trevligt, sedan visar v√§rdinnan upp mot rummet och ber√§ttar under tiden om hotellets utbud.
Det finns flera restauranger och barer ( 6 tror jag ) har provat 3 av dom med h√∂sta betyg fr√•n mig, mycket god mat och super bra service.

Poolomr√•det √§r min favorit! Byt om nere p√• Jiiva spa, du f√•r ett sk√•p f√∂r kl√§der, finns √•ngbastu, torrbastu, duschar och relaxrum d√§r du kan drick gott te och bara njuta.
Uppe p√• Poolomr√•det hj√§lper the poolboy till att fixa solstol med handdukar och du f√•r vattenflaskor hela tiden, f√∂r det blir varmt d√§r!
N√§r man har solar klart och byter om s√• har dom en "" badbyxcentrifug"" s√• bara sk√∂lja badbyxorna och centrifugera s√• f√•r man med torra upp till rummet!

Och rummet: superiorrummet inneh√•ller en soffsittgrupp, skrivbord med olika tekniska anslutningar, en stor sk√∂n dubbels√§ng med kuddmeny, badrum med badkar och dusch, det finns champo, duschcreme mm mm.
Badrummen skulle beh√∂va en upprenovering, √§r inte Up to date!
Du kan koka te/kaffe om du blir sugen ing√•r.

Mumbai,"Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai",5 stars out of 5,"Detta √§r ett klassiskt hotell som kanske inte h√•ller den standard man f√∂rv√§ntar sig, men som √§nd√• inte g√∂r en besviken. Rummet jag fick luktade lite unket och standarden var s√•d√§r, r√§tt s√• slitet. Men utsikten fantastisk, pool-omr√•det i tr√§dg√•rden lyxig f√∂r att inte tala om k√§nslan av att sitta i pelarg√•ngarna och avnjuta en lunch."
